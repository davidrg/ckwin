    Last updates: 22 Aug 2022 (HELP TYPE adds /INTERPRET switch).
                  20 Sep 2022 (HELP COPY adds /INTERPRET, /TOSCREEN switches).
                  06 Nov 2022 (fixed formatting of HELP SET TELNET).
                  12 Nov 2022 (converted four function help strings to arrays).
                  02 Dec 2022 (changed ssh v2 macs list in windows "help ssh").
                  03 Dec 2022 (fixed misplaced definition of cr_year).
                  12 Apr 2023 (ANSI-ize function definitions)

  This module contains HELP command and other long text strings.

  IMPORTANT: As of 2022, character string constants longer than about 509 are
  not portable.  Longer strings should be broken up into arrays of strings and
  accessed with hmsga() rather than hmsg().  The length limit might be lower
  in older C compilers.
