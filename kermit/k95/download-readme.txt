The DOWNLOAD directory

Kermit 95's DOWNLOAD directory is for downloading files into, if you
like to always put all your downloaded files into the same directory.

Your other choice is to put downloaded files into Kermit 95's current
directory.

The File Transfer Settings window for each connection lets you make
this choice. If you fill in a directory name (such as DOWNLOAD, which
is supplied by default), it will be used for all downloads. If you
don't, the current directory is used.

Use Kermit's CD command to change your current directory.

Use Kermit's SET FILE DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY command to change your
download directory. Give this command without any directory name to
specify that downloaded files should go into the current directory.
