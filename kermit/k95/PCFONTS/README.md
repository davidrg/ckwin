Soft Fonts for Kermit/2
=======================

These fonts are used to build pcfonts.dll, a collection of soft fonts available
for use by full-screen Kermit/2 sessions using the `SET TERMINAL FONT` command.
Included are:

```
  CP437 - Original PC code page
  CP850 - "Multilingual" (West Europe) code page
  CP852 - East Europe Roman Alphabet (Czech, Polish, etc)
  CP862 - Hebrew
  CP866 - Cyrillic (Russian, Belorussian, and Ukrainian)
```

This allows Kermit/2 to display text in the following languages regardless of
what OS/2 National Language version is in use:

Albanian, Belorussian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, 
Faeroese, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Italian,
Ladino, Latin, Macedonian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, 
Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Swiss, Ukrainian, and Yiddish.

These fonts were originally collected by Joseph (Yossi (Yogi)) Gil at the 
Technion in Haifa, Israel. Licensing information is provided in
[copyleft.txt](copyleft.txt) but the TL;DR of it is the individual fonts are 
considered public domain.

All files here were extracted from fntcol16.zip dated 3-November-1994 originally
available from ftp://ssl.cs.technion.ac.il/pub/DOS/Yogi/ and mirrored at various
