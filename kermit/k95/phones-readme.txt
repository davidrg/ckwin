File PHONES\README.TXT

Kermit 95's PHONES subdirectory contains dialing and network directories. Long
ago these listed access numbers and addresses for many BBS and network services
around the world, but those are all long gone now.

If you operate a service you think would be suitable for inclusion in K95s
default dialing and/or network directories, you can make a suggestion at:

CKERMIT.KDD
  Kermit Dialing Directory.  This is approximately the phone list for
  all the preloaded entries in the dialer.  It is not actually used by
  the dialer.

CKERMIT.KND
  Kermit Network Directory.  This is the network hosts list for the network
  services that are preloaded in the dialer.  This file is not actually used
  by the dialer either.
