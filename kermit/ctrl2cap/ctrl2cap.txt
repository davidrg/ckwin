CTRL2CAPS                                                        June 1996

  NOTE: With the recent release by Microsoft of its "Kernel Toys",
  which includes a similar, and more general, key-swapping capability,
  you might prefer to use the Microsoft utility:

CTRL2CAPS.VXD is device driver that swaps the Caps Lock and Left Ctrl keys
on the PC keyboard in Windows 95, for use by those who prefer to have the
Control key just left of the A key, rather than its present placement on
PC keyboards, which is not handy for touch typists.

This is the second version of CTRL2CAPS, which adds the option to swap the
Esc and accent grave (`) keys:

  To enable the escape/accent grave switching, put the following lines in
  system.ini (anywhere):

  [ctrl2cap]
  escape=TRUE

  This version changes caps-lock into control, but not vice versa 
  (neither myself, nor any UNIX programmer I know ever use Caps Lock).

CTRL2CAPS.VXD was tested within the Kermit Project for several months with no
visible ill effects, but it is provided with no guarantees of any kind -- USE
AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Here is the original announcement Mark Russinovich, who
wrote it:

Here is the uuencoded VxD that switches the control and caps keys 
for both DOS boxes and Windows in general under Windows 95.

To enable it, put the line:

device=<PATH>/ctrl2cap.vxd

in the [386enh] section of your WINDOWS\SYSTEM.INI file.
