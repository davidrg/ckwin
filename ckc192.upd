C-KERMIT 5A(190) EDIT HISTORY, 5 AUG 93 - 4 OCT 94.

In ckutio.c, corrected a typo that might have prevented setting a serial
port's speed to 57600 bps.  Also, consistently added support for 57600 and
115200 bps if symbols for those speeds are defined.  (But this is still an
issue for the command processor, which does not have access to
system-dependent symbols like this).  ckutio.c 5A(111), 5 Aug 93.

From Bill Glass - fixed a statistics counter (file bytes) that was still
counting some non-file material (contents of server command packets) in
the decode() function.  ckcfns.c 5A(090), 6 Aug 93.

Added types to all functions in VMS-specific modules, CKVFIO.C and CKVTIO.C
(CKVCON was already OK) to pacify the new, stricter Alpha AXP (DEC C)
compilers.  CKVFIO.C 5A(056), CKUTIO.C 5A(101), 8 Aug 93.

Added patches to enable SET FLOW RTS/CTS in Linux, originally from Rick
Sladkey, jrs@world.std.com.  Depends on symbol "linux".  ckcdeb.h, ckutio.c.

Terry Kennedy pointed out that VMS C-Kermit follows FILE TYPE when
TRANSMITting, even if it is IMAGE or LABELED.  Changed the TRANSMIT command
to treat any of the system-specific binary modes (IMAGE, LABELED, MACBINARY,
etc) as ordinary binary mode, i.e. saved and restored the "binary" variable
in the TRANSMIT command.  ckuus4.c, 10 Aug 93.

Shinichi Sakata <ssakata@weber.ucsd.edu> discovered that if an "application
file" (a file whose name is given as the first command-line argument) contains
a CD command, that C-Kermit would, after finishing the application file,
act as if it had been given an invalid command-line argument.  Fixed by adding
yet another flag, cfilef - set in ckcmai.c, tested in ckuusy.c.  10 Aug 93.

From Rob Weiner <rweiner@watsun.cc.columbia.edu>, a new makefile entry,
sys5r4sxtcpc, for CONSENSYS System V R4.2-1 with TCP/IP and curses.  makefile.
12 Aug 93.

From Rich Sladkey <jrs@world.std.com>: (1) fix prototype of ttrpid() in
ckutio.c; (2) fix fixes to Linux hardware flow control.  It's still ugly
internally, but cleaning up the hardware flow control code would be a major
undertaking due to the geometrically expanding combinations of flow control
settings and different APIs for setting them.  ckutio.c 5A(112) 22 Aug 93.

Added conditional compilation support for system-wide init file.  If the
compile-time symbol CK_SYSINI is defined (to be a character string in
doublequotes), it is taken as the file specification of the initialization
file, to be used instead of the built-in default.  This can be absolute or
relative, so it can point to a single system-wide file, or to something like
~/.kermrc (UNIX) or SYS$LOGIN:CKERMIT.INI (VMS) to indicate the user's own.
If it is system wide, it can (and probably should) still "chain" to the user's
own initialization file, by ending (or starting, depending on the desired
precedence) with a command like:

  if exist \v(home)ckermit.ini take \v(home)ckermit.ini

ckuus5.c, 10 Sep 93.

Fixes for VMS C-Kermit, all in CKVTIO.C:
 * 058 27-Sep-93 HG   Fix for real the SHARE issue when allocating terminal
 *		      by dropping SHARE before trying to assign the channel.
 * 059  7-Oct-93 mlo  Added support for CMU-OpenVMS/IP ("CMU/Tek").  Requires
 *                    CMU-OpenVMS/IP sockets library, also by mlo.
 * 060  9-Oct-93 HG   Fix improper call to vms_assign_channel in edit 058,
 *                    noticed by Fritz@GEMS.VCU.EDU.
 * 061  9-Oct-93 fdc  For some reason, conbin() was turning off flow control.
 *                    This caused massive data loss during CONNECT mode when
 *                    running C-Kermit from a low-speed connection through
 *                    a DECserver.  Now conbin() leaves the console flow
 *                    control setting alone.
 * 062 10-Oct-93 ttj  Correcting parameters to time() and ctime(). Was long,
 *                    is now time_t (pointers).  Made prototype for
 *                    vms_assign_channel and caught an erroneous function call.

Plus CMU/Tek TCP/IP support for VMS C-Kermit from Mike O'Malley at DEC
<mlomall@sav324.sandia.gov>; minor source changes to CKCNET.C, CKCNET.H,
CKUUS4.C, and (noted above) CKVTIO.C.

Plus compiler-related and/or typo fixes to CKVFIO.C from Tarjei Jensen:
 * 102 18-Aug-93 ttj Minor updates in zsattr() and do_label_recv() mainly to
 *                   quieten the compiler (which had every reason to complain).
(Installed 10 Oct 93).

Added keypad period (".") to the list of numeric keypad keys that return
different scan codes from their main keypad equivalents -- final step in
making the PC numeric keypad able to work like the DEC one.  From Kai Uwe
Rommel.  ckotio.c 5A(105) 11 Oct 93.

Corrections to X.25 functions from <David_Lane_@vos.stratus.com>: A PAD
command (either a SET, READ, or SETANDREAD) without any parameters specified
in the command means "all supported parameters."  For the SET commands, it is
a "reset to initial values."  As passed to qbitpkt(), n is the number of data
bytes in the packet, which starts at s.  The control byte has already been
stripped off.  When passed to either setpad() or readpad(), n is the number of
parameters in the command/query.  ckcnet.c 5A(020) 13 Oct 93.

A change from Alex Dupuy <dupuy@smarts.com>: if C-Kermit is compiled with
-DNOCMDL (no command-line arguments) and -DNOICP (no interactive command
parser), then instead of building a program that just exits, build one that
goes into server mode with all default settings.  Alex suggests that we can
also rip out all local-mode supporting code in this case (since there is no
way to SET LINE any more) to make a truly minimal remote-only version.
Settings can still be accomplished via REMOTE SET commands.  C-Kermit built
on a PC with 'make dellsys5r4m "KFLAGS=-DNOCMDL -DNOICP"' weighs in at 90K.
ckcmai.c 5A(190) 14 Oct 93.

Changed the protocol module to issue "KERMIT READY TO blah..." messages
consistently, and to make them appear (in remote mode) no matter whether
the file transfer command was given interactively or from a command file
or macro.  ckcpro.w 5A(056) 14 Oct 93.

Changes for BSDI from John T. Kohl <jtk@kolvir.blrc.ma.us>.  ckcdeb.h,
ckutio.c.  Aside from adjusting BSDI-isms, John (partially) fixed a big
problem with tthflow() that had previously been hacked around in the Linux
case, by passing the appropriate terminal info structure to tthflow() as an
argument.  I removed the special case for Linux.  Unfortunately, the hardware
flow control status is not kept in the terminal info on some systems,
e.g. SVR4, SunOS.  And since John started things off in this direction, I made
further attempts to clean up the hardware flow control situtation in the UNIX
version, adding a new parameter to tthflow() to specify whether hardware f/c
is to be turned on (1) or off (0), and then replacing various chunks of
misplaced system-specific code by calls to tthflow().  Compiles OK on SunOS
4.1.3, 4.4BSD, SVR4, needs testing.  ckutio.c 5A(113) 20 Oct 93.

John also added a new command, which he called PUSHREM and which I decided to
call REDIRECT, which is like RUN, but with stdin and stdout redirected to the
communication device (serial or network connection).  For UNIX only, needs
forks, dup(), wait(), and needs <sys/wait.h> to define WIFEXITED() and
WEXITSTATUS().  This commmand is compiled in only if the symbol CK_REDIR is
defined at compile time, and then only when NOPUSH is not defined.  Fixed up,
adapted to, and tested on SunOS 4.1.3, SVR4, Linux.  Could not get it working
on the NeXT or AIX, which have no definition for WEXITSTATUS().  If you try to
build the program with CK_REDIR defined and the required macros are not
available, C-Kermit will print a message "?Sorry, can't execute this command -
missing pieces" if you try to use the REDIRECT command.  Also, I added a new
token, "<" (leftbracket), as a synonym for REDIRECT (like "!" is a synonym for
RUN), and, when CK_REDIR is defined, made "red" and "redi" valid non-unique
abbreviations for REDIAL.  ckuusr.h, ckuusr.c 5A(104), ckutio.c, ckuus[25].c.
25 Oct 93.

Added "designer banners" for Linux and BSDI BSD/386.  ckuver.h.  20 Oct 93.

After testing of new RTS/CTS code by Rick Sladkey, made some more changes,
unified Linux and BSDI RTS/CTS code, reorganized, consolidated, cleaned up,
documented.  ckutio.c 5A(114) 21 Oct 93.

Fixes from Chuck Goodhart <ceg@hyper-bret.jpl.nasa.gov>:
 . The SCRIPT command can sometimes cause TELNET negotiations to be ignored.
 . The SCRIPT command is slowed by unbuffered output to the console
   and the session log.
 . The SCRIPT command does not filter out carriage returns when
   SET SESSION-LOG TEXT is set.
 . While SET SESSION-LOG TEXT, TELNET negotiations should not be logged.
 . The INPUT command is also slowed by unbuffered output to the console and
   the session log.
 . ttinc(timo) should ignore the timeout when, if MYREAD buffered
   input is being used, a character is known to be available.  This
   saves two calls to signal() and two calls to alarm(), dramatically
   improving the performance of the INPUT command.
ckuscr.c 5A(017), ckutio.c 5A(115), ckuus4.c 5A(105), ckcnet.c 5A(021),
21 Oct 93.  And again, ckuscr.c 5A(018) 25 Oct 93.

Fixed a bug that caused TELNET negotiations to be ignored if C-Kermit was
used to make a TELNET connection, then a serial connection, and then a
another TELNET connection, in that order.  ckuus7.c, 25 Oct 93.

Merged in support for a whole new and different proprietary operating system,
Stratus VOS, from David Lane at Bellsouth <David_Lane_@vos.stratus.com>.  This
is a full new C-Kermit implementation, including TCP/IP and X.25.  Changes to
all modules are within #ifdef STRATUS..#endif.  For X.25, the symbol is
STRATUSX25.  Elements common to SunLink and Stratus X.25 are now combined
under the new ANYX25 symbol.  All ckc* and cku* modules affected (except
cku[ft]io.c).  All modules must now #include "ckcsym.h" first thing to pick up
other symbol definitions -- the VOS C compiler doesn't allow -D/-d for this.
David also VOS-ified the ckbmkb and ckbunb programs, wart, and the malloc
debugger.  25 Oct 93.  Supporting system-dependent modules -- ckl*.[ch] --
still to come, along with VOS-specific documentation, build procedure, etc.

Last month, Olaf Seibert <rhialto@mbfys.kun.nl> pointed out that C-Kermit,
particularly on the Mac, would seem to operate in stop-and-wait mode,
even though a nonzero window size was successfully negotiated.  The behavior
would sometimes change during the transfer a particular file -- windowing
one minute, stop-and-wait the next.  Olaf figured out that, in the "PARSENSE"
case (in which C-Kermit's packet reader is length-driven rather than waiting
for the packet terminator), the packet terminator is left over in the buffer.
Meanwhile, back in sdata() -- the Data-Packet sender in ckcfns.c -- the
following code:

	spack('D',pktnum,len,data);	/* Send the data packet. */
	x = ttchk();			/* Peek at input buffer. */
	debug(F101,"sdata ttchk","",x);	/* ACKs waiting, maybe?  */
	if (x) return(1);		/* Yes, stop sending data packets */

checks whether *any* data has arrived, in which case it breaks out of sending
the current windowful and goes to read a packet.  And that's just what happens
when the packet terminator is still waiting to be read.  The fix turned out to
be simple:

	if (x) return(1);
becomes:
	if (x > 4) return(1);

The minimum number of characters in a Kermit packet is 5, so we don't break
out of the send loop unless there are at least that many characters waiting.
This tiny change should speed things up quite a bit in situations where
windowing is needed.  ckcfns.c 5A(092) 25 Oct 93.

Fixed an incorrect test (nettype == NP_TELNET) in ckvtio.c.  5A(030) 27 Oct 93.
Noticed by David Lane.

Fixed incorrect setting of network type via command-line arguments.
Noticed by David Lane.  ckuusy.c.

Changed the UNIX CONNECT command to buffer keystrokes, rather than reading
them one at a time.  This turns out to be important when C-Kermit is "in the
middle", in CONNECT mode, between two other computers that are transferring
data.  Fulvio Marino of Olivetti in Italy recoded C-Kermit's communications
and console i/o for this very reason, but his changes are massive and would
require months or years of testing, debugging, adaptation to every UNIX
variant in the world, etc, which might well be worth it, since his generalized
i/o buffering scheme makes most kinds of i/o in Kermit MUCH faster and easier
on the system in terms of cycles, system calls, etc...  In other words, the
present change is just a quick fix to get a modest improvement in this
particular case.  Benchmarks using a 58K file on a network connection:

					   No Buffering   With Buffering
  SEND through C-Kermit in CONNECT mode:      102 sec         47 sec
  TRANSMIT thru C-Kermit in CONNECT mode:     237 sec         94 sec

So, about a 100%+ speedup.

The buffer size is only 256 bytes, since that's the biggest amount that UNIX
itself seems to buffer from the console (i.e. tests on SunOS showed that
conchk() never returned a value greater than 256).  No ill or side effects
were noted -- CONNECT works in the normal way during interactive use.
ckucon.c 5A(055) 27 Oct 93.

This code could not be adapted to VMS C-Kermit because of the insane way that
it reads characters from the keyboard.  It was not adapted to OS/2 because
OS/2 C-Kermit is never "in the middle".

Changed the SET NETWORK keyword table to allow any combination of networks
without getting compile-time syntax errors caused by too many or too few
commas.  Problem noticed by David Lane when he built VOS C-Kermit with X.25
and no TCP/IP.  ckuusr.c 5A(107), 28 Oct 93.

Added vanity herald for NetBSD based on preprocessor symbol __NetBSD__.
ckuver.h, 28 Oct 93.

Disabled -j command-line option if TCPSOCKET not defined.
Disabled -X and -Y command-line options if ANYX25 not defined.
Suggested by David Lane.  ckuusy.c, 29 Oct 93.

Added a new variable, \v(parity), to allow script programs to get the current
parity, in case they need to save, change, and restore it, e.g. around a
dialog with a modem that doesn't work right if it sees a parity bit.
ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, 29 Oct 93.

Added a new variable, \v(dialstatus), a return code from the last DIAL
command, either success or else any of twenty-some specific error codes (busy,
no answer, no dialtone, etc).  This allows users to write script programs that
can decide whether to redial based on the failure reason.  For now, the value
of \v(dialstatus) is a number.  ckcker.h, ckudia.c, ckuus4.c.  The failure
reason codes are:

#define DIA_UNK  -1			/* No DIAL command given yet */
#define DIA_OK    0			/* DIAL succeeded */
#define DIA_NOMO  1			/* Modem type not specified */
#define DIA_NOLI  2			/* Communication line not spec'd */
#define DIA_OPEN  3			/* Line can't be opened */
#define DIA_NOSP  4			/* Speed not specified */
#define DIA_HANG  5			/* Hangup failure */
#define DIA_IE    6			/* Internal error (malloc, etc) */
#define DIA_IO    7			/* I/O error */
#define DIA_TIMO  8			/* Dial timeout expired */
#define DIA_INTR  9			/* Dialing interrupted by user */
#define DIA_NRDY  10			/* Modem not ready */
#define DIA_ERR   20			/* Modem command error */
#define DIA_NOIN  21			/* Failure to initialize modem */
#define DIA_BUSY  22			/* Phone busy */
#define DIA_NOCA  23			/* No carrier */
#define DIA_NODT  24			/* No dialtone */
#define DIA_RING  25			/* Ring, incoming call */
#define DIA_NOAN  26			/* No answer */
#define DIA_DISC  27			/* Disconnected */
#define DIA_VOIC  28			/* Answered by voice */
#define DIA_NOAC  29			/* Access denied, forbidden call */
#define DIA_UERR  98			/* Unknown error */
#define DIA_UNSP  99		/* Unspecified failure detected by modem */

From Jamie Watson <jw@adasoft.ch>:

- On AIX 3.x, the xon/xoff and rts/cts values in the tty line discipline
  stack are saved on startup and restored on exit.  This fixes a very
  irritating problem in which C-Kermit could leave a tty in a state that
  was unusable by uucp or cu.

- The REDIRECT command is enabled and working on AIX 3.x and on DEC Ultrix.
  The AIX version has been tested on AIX 3.1.5 and AIX 3.2.x (heaven only
  knows what the "x" might be; I defy anyone to assign a specific value
  to any currently running AIX 3.2 system).
  The Ultrix version has been tested on a DECsystem 5000/25, Ultrix 4.3,
  and on a MicroVAX 2000, Ultrix 4.2.

ckutio.c 5A(116) 1 Nov 93.

Jamie also noticed that the new keyboard-input buffering invariably caused
CONNECT/TELNET to fail under AIX, as it would have under most any System V
implementation.  The culprit turns out to be that the read() in kbget() was
getting interrupted by the lower CONNECT fork as a result of TELNET echo
negotiations, thus read() would fail with EINTR.  Solution: ignore EINTR
errors when read()ing from keyboard during CONNECT.  ckucon.c 5A(056) 1 Nov 93.

Fixed prototype-mismatch complaints in new buffering code in SCRIPT and INPUT
commands.  ckuscr.c 5A(019), ckuus4.c, 1 Nov 93.

Added a compile-time symbol for ckufio.c: ISREGBUG.  If this symbol is
defined, it tells ckufio.c to define S_ISREG and S_ISDIR itself, rather than
using definitions from header files, when the latter don't work.  There is
already code in ckufio.c to do this for certain systems, but the new symbol
allows it to be done from the CC command line (or with KFLAGS on the "make"
command line) without modifying the source code.  This is necessary for at
least one of the NCR UNIX versions.

Added numeric C-Kermit program version number to OS/2 C-Kermit ENQ/Answerback
string so now it says "OS/2 C-Kermit 501190".  ckocon.c 5A(104), 2 Nov 93.

From CKUKER.BWR:
"If a file arrives that has the same name as a directory, and C-Kermit's FILE
COLLISION setting is BACKUP, C-Kermit will either: (a) rename the directory,
or (b) not be able to rename the directory and so will refuse the incoming
file with the message "Can't transform filename".  Similarly, if C-Kermit's
FILE COLLISION setting is OVERWRITE, C-Kermit will, hopefully (!), not be able
to delete the directory, and so will refuse the incoming file."

And from CKOKER.BWR:
"You can't give a command like "RECEIVE A:".  C-Kermit will fail to open
the output file.  You must also include a filename, e.g. "RECEIVE A:X.X"."

These are now fixed.  C-Kermit -- at least the UNIX and OS/2 versions -- now
has the ability to recognize disk and directory names when they are given as
output filespecs.  When this happens, primarily when "as-names" are given in
RECEIVE or GET commands, or in a '-a' command-line argument, C-Kermit now
changes its directory (or disk) to the one given for the duration of that
command, and then restores the previous current disk/directory when the
command is done.  So now in UNIX, you can say "receive foo", where foo is a
directory name (relative or absolute, need not end in slash), and C-Kermit
will CD to that directory and store all the incoming files there under their
own names until protocol mode exits, at which time C-Kermit goes back to the
directory that was current when the RECEIVE command was given.  If "foo" is
not a directory, then C-Kermit stores the (first) incoming file in the current
directory, under the name of "foo", as before.  This feature depends on the
symbol CK_TMPDIR, which is automatically defined in ckcker.h for UNIX and
OS/2, and a new supporting CK?FIO.C function, isdir(), which has been filled
in for UNIX and OS/2.  Also, files that arrive under names which correspond to
directory names are no longer able to cause renaming or other modification to
directory files, and useful error messages are now returned in this case.
Also, 'kermit -r' is bit more careful about checking whether the output file
can be created before going into protocol mode.  ckcker.h, ckcfns.c 5A(093),
ckuus[r56y].c 5A(108), ckufio.c 5A(075), 2 Nov 93.

(Ideally, the receiving system should be able to send back a fully qualified
file specification in the ACK to F packet, but most systems where C-Kermit
runs are not able to do this.  The temporary directory name might be absolute
or relative, might have or lack a terminating separator, etc, so we'd need a
ton of system-dependent code to do this right.)

Added the ability to repaint the fullscreen file transfer display screen, for
example if the screen gets messed up by talk or broadcast messages during file
transfer.  User types Ctrl-L (or L) to repaint.  Internally, two methods are
used.  If the symbol CK_WREFRESH is defined, which can be added to ckcdeb.h
for a particular version (as I have done for SunOS, NeXTSTEP, and AIX), or
added to a makefile entry, or given as "KFLAGS=-DCK_WREFRESH", or otherwise
defined at compile time, then the real-curses-library functions clearok() and
wrefresh() are called, which totally repaint the screen -- just what we want.
Otherwise, Kermit uses a do-it-yourself method which clears the screen and
repaints most of the fields, but not all of them, because certain information
might be lost by the time repainting occurs, such as the filename and the
direction of transfer.  The latter method works for all implementations of
fullscreen file transfer display, but making this method work for all fields
would be a major recoding task, and would add a lot of complexity and storage
space, basically duplicating the functionality of curses itself (keeping each
field, or an entire screen image, for repainting purposes).  ckcdeb.h,
ckuusx.c, ckuus5.c, 3 Nov 93.

Added CK_WREFRESH for AT&T System V R3 and later, since it's in the SVID.
Also for BSD 4.4 and derivatives.  However, this type of change is always
risky, so I also added a new symbol, NOWREFRESH, to allow this decision to be
overriden from the CC or 'make' command line.  In other words, if your linker
complains that _clearok or _wrefresh are undefined, then "touch ckuusx.c"
and rebuild with -DNOWREFRESH.  ckcdeb.h, 3 Nov 93.

Added VMS support for CK_WREFRESH, contributed by William Bader
<wbader@pluto.CSEE.Lehigh.Edu>.  ckcdeb.h, ckuusx.c, 4 Nov 93.

Added a makefile entry for DECstation 5000 models based on R4000 "MIPS-3"
chip, Ultrix 4.3A, from Jamie Watson <jw@adasoft.ch>.  4 Nov 93.

A few more minor Stratus VOS changes, having to do with X.25, from David Lane.
ckcmai.c, ckuus7.c.  4 Nov 93.

Added KANJI, RTS/CTS, Curses, CK_WREFRESH to DEC OSF/1 version, built, tested
OK on OSF/1-AlphaAXP 1.3.111.  RTS/CTS compiled OK, but I don't know if it
actually works.  REDIRECT compiles but doesn't work ("missing pieces").
4 Nov 93.

Added CK_TMPDIR feature to VMS version.  isdir() function for VMS received
from William Bader <wbader@pluto.csee.lehigh.edu>.  Moved CK_TMPDIR definition
from ckcker.h to ckcdeb.h, because we might want to use it in the ck?fio.c
modules.  ckuusr.c, ckcker.h, ckcker.h, ckcfns.c, ckuus[r6].c;
ckvfio.c 5A(102), 5 Nov 93. 

Rearranged #ifdefs for CK_SYSINI (compile-time option for system-wide init
file) and moved them from ckuusr.c to ckuusr.h.  Now you can (at least in
UNIX) give CK_DSYSINI as a command-line option to accept a built-in default
fully qualified file specification for a system-wide C-Kermit init file,
/usr/local/bin/kermit.sysini.  5 Nov 93.

Added Stratus-VOS-specific modules from David R. Lane, SoftCom Systems Inc:
cklcon.c, cklfio.c, ckltio.c, cklnet.c (includes TCP/IP and X.25), ckldef.c,
plus build procedure cklmak.cm.  5 Nov 93.

Added automatic enabling of REDIRECT command for various UNIX systems where
we know it works in ckcdeb.h.  Can be overridden by defining NOREDIRECT at
compile time.  6 Nov 93.

Fixed stupid mistake in system-wide init-file #ifdefs, noticed by Jamie
Watson.  ckuusr.h, 6 Nov 93.  Also, fixed SHOW commands to display system-wide
init file name if it has been configured and used, and to allow more space for
displaying it.  Also, changed init file name buffer to be dynamically
allocated if DCMDBUF defined, and increased its size from 100 to 256 since it
can now be a full path name.

Added a new command-line argument: -D n (uppercase D followed by a number),
equivalent of SET DELAY command.  Jamie Watson noticed there was no way to
get Kermit to use a shorter (or different) delay when sending files via
command-line arguments.  ckuusy.c.  6 Nov 93.

Added correct identification of Alpha (AXP) CPU for \v(cpu), designer banners
for DEC OSF/1 on Alpha.  Also added O2 optimization, ANSI C prototyping, plus
REDIRECT command is now working on Alpha-OSF/1.  \v(cpu) also works on OpenVMS
AXP.  Combined dec-osf and dec-osf-pc UNIX makefile entries.  6 Nov 93.

After EXITing from the wrong Kermit one time too many, unintentionally
dropping a connection, I added a new command SET EXIT WARNING { ON, OFF }.
If ON, and Kermit is in local mode, and it thinks it has an open serial or
network connection, it will warn you and give you a chance to back out of
the EXIT command.  EXIT WARNING OFF is the default, for compatibility.
ckuusr.h ckuusr.c ckuus3.c, 6 Nov 93.  NOTE: the ability of C-Kermit to know
whether a connection is open or not depends on a lot of system-dependent
things.  In UNIX and OS/2, Kermit's guess is pretty reliable, based on the
"tty" file descriptor (ttyfd), modem signals, etc.  In other versions, we
can't tell so well, so we always warn and ask if EXIT WARNING is ON.

In the course of adding SET EXIT WARNING, fixed a bug in the command package,
in which, if a temporary prompt was in effect and prompt() was called with a
NULL conversion function, then ?-help would put back the regular prompt
instead of the temporary one.  ckucmd.c 5A(055) 6 Nov 93.

Added SHOW EXIT to display EXIT WARNING setting, exit status.  ckuus5.c.

Added ttruncmd() code for OS/2 from Kai Uwe Rommel, and enabled
REDIRECT command for OS/2.  ckotio.c 5A(106), 6 Nov 93.

Added IF DIRECTORY command.  Succeeds if operand is a directory, fails
otherwise.  Uses new isdir() function, currently filled in for UNIX, VMS,
OS/2.  Is included if CK_TMPDIR symbol is defined.  ckuusr.h, ckuus6.c,
6 Nov 93.

Added IF NEWER command.  Compares modification (or creation) date/times
of two files, succeeds if first file is newer than second file.  Depends
on zfcdat() function, which is defined for most versions, but not for VMS
or OS-9.  Added a section to ckcdeb.h that defines the symbol ZFCDAT for
each implementation that provides this function.  ckcdeb.h, ckuusr.h,
ckuus6.c, 6 Nov 93.

Added new function \Fdate(filename).  Available if ZFCDAT is defined.
Returns creation date of file in "yyyymmdd hh:mm:ss" format, or else the
null string upon failure.  Also changed SHOW FUNCTIONS to do "more?"-style
paging, like SHOW VARIABLES.  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, ckuus5.c.  6 Nov 93.

Changed SET BUFFERS command to default the second (receive) buffer to be
the same size as the first (send) buffer, so user doesn't have to type two
numbers.  ckuus3.c, 6 Nov 93.

Added CK_WREFRESH support for DEC ULTRIX (all versions) and IBM RT PC AIX.
Verified by Jamie Watson.  ckcdeb.h, 7 Nov 93.

Increased -Olimit for ULTRIX 4.2, since new \v(dialstatus) code pushed the
optimizer over the edge.  From Jamie Watson.  makefile, 7 Nov 93.

Changed SET EXIT WARNING to not warn on a serial connection if SET CARRIER
is OFF.  ckuusr.c, 7 Nov 93.

Added SET EXIT STATUS to let user set program return code without actually
having to exit.  For example, user can OR in various bits at different times.
ckuus3.c, 7 Nov 93.

Updated UNIX man page.  ckuker.nr, 8 Nov 93.

Added zfcdat() to VMS version, for \fdate(filename), IF NEWER, etc.
Contributed by William Bader.  CKVFIO.C 5A(104), 9 Nov 93.

Changed VMS C-Kermit version to always be in foreground mode, i.e. to never
set the backgrd flag.  There is no notion of background (in the UNIX sense) in
VMS.  If C-Kermit is not running on a real terminal, then either it has its
SYS$INPUT and/or SYS$OUTPUT redirected, or it's running in batch.  In either
case, it can always do console output.  Also, I installed a patch from
<tcwkw@sf.msc.edu> to sysinit() to prevent it from trying to get info about
the console terminal when the console is not a terminal.  CKVTIO.C 2.0(063),
9 Nov 93.

Got new LIBCMU ...

Discovered that the new INPUT buffering broke code the INPUT command under
certain circumstances, notably when using a VMS C-Kermit script to make a
TCP/IP connection; after the first 1-second timeout, netinc(1) would start to
get i/o errors (socket_errno == EBUSY, "Mount device busy") and then would
return -1 immediately without actually timing out any more.  The INPUT
buffering code made the erroneous assumption that if ttchk() returned a
positive number n, that n successive calls to ttinc() would succeed, and this
is apparently not always the case in VMS.  For now, the quick fix is to remove
the INPUT buffering code (I left it in place, but conditionalized on CK_BURST,
which is #undef'd).  When I have some spare time, I'll change INPUT to do its
own buffering, just like CONNECT, rather than relying on some unseen and
possibly unreliable underlying buffering mechanism.  ckuus4.c, 9 Nov 93.

Edited OS/2 section of standard (sample) CKERMOD.INI file to not swap Esc and
accent grave keys, and to include hint messages about key mapping and colors.

Changed -Otcl in SCO Xenix 3.2 to -O.  It seems that -Otcl was producing bad
code, at least in the SCRIPT command (noticed by Michael Haws
<michael@suntex.com>; expect strings would always fail).  makefile, 12 Nov 93.

Added \v(keyboard) for OS/2 C-Kermit.  Returns keyboard type: 88, 101, 122,
are the known types.  If OS/2 senses some other type, its 4-byte hex code is
returned.  If OS/2 fails to get the keyboard type, the empty string is
returned.  Code adapted from Kai Uwe Rommel's example.  ckcdeb.h, ckuusr.h,
ckuus4.c, ckotio.c, cpcplm.doc.  15 Nov 93.

Added WILL SGA response to DO SGA.  This never came up before.  Problem
reported by Wayne Hauber <wjhauber@isstate.edu>, with Apartus Technologies
Telnet Gateway Service to Iowa State U Library's NOTIS system.  ckcnet.c
5A(022), 17 Nov 93.

Changed debug log entries for TELNET negotiations to be one-liners, all
starting with TELNET, looking mostly like the UNIX telnet "toggle options"
display.  Now you can get all TELNET negotions via "grep ^TELNET debug.log".
ckcnet.c.  17 Nov 93.

Peter Kabal <kabal@aldebaran.ee.mcgill.ca> noticed that SET SPEED can fail in
Ultrix 4.2 on the DECstation 2100 for speeds over 9600, but the system call
does not return any error indication.  Therefore, all three places in C-Kermit
that call ttsspd() to set the device's speed were changed to read it back
with ttgspd() before setting the global 'speed' variable.  ckuus3.c, ckuus7.c,
ckuusy.c, 17 Nov 93.

Changed the OS/2 C-Kermit installation procedure to skip all COM-port related
questions if the user says she will not be using a COM port (e.g. for
TCP/IP-only installation), and to skip modem-related questions if a modem will
not be used.  ckoins.cmd (= install.cmd), 17 Nov 93.

Discovered why certain login scripts were not working on OS/2.  The clause
"for (j = i; i-- > 0; )" was not generating the intended code, at least not
when compiled by IBMCPP (the same code worked OK in most other versions).
Moved the decrementing of i into the loop and then it worked fine.  ckuus4.c,
18 Nov 93.

After successfully executing a login script, OS/2 C-Kermit tended to have its
echoing wrong.  To alleviate this problem, apparently caused by tn_ini() being
called multiple times gratuitously, in spite of seemingly scrupulous setting
and clearing of the tn_init flag at all appropriate places, I removed all
calls to tn_ini() (and all references to tn_init) from all modules of all
C-Kermit versions.  tn_ini() is now called only from within net_open(), after
net_open() has determined that it has just made a successful TELNET
connection.  Many modules affected: ck*tio.c, ck*net.c, ck*con.c, 18 Nov 93.

Changed OS/2 C-Kermit "set terminal color normal" to "set terminal color
terminal-screen", which makes more sense.  Left "normal" as an invisible
synonym.  ckuus7.c, 18 Nov 93.

Discovered that TELNET'ing from OS/2 C-Kermit to a host with a long name
tended not to work.  In one case ("telnet martini.eecs.umich.edu 3000"), it
would crash C-Kermit completely.  Traced the problem to (a) an inadequate
buffer size in ckotio.c, which in turn was based on a pre-network definition
of the symbol DEVNAMLEN, and (b) the use of strcpy() rather than strncpy() in
ckocon for setting up the status line.  Also, I rearranged the status line
to give more room to display the host name.
ckocon.c 5A(105), ckotio.c 5A(108) 18 Nov 93.

REDIRECT doesn't work on OS/2 network connections, so I changed the REDIRECT
command to fail under these conditions (instead of doing nothing).  ckuusr.c
5A(111) 18 Nov 93.

The INPUT command did not work correctly on VMS systems with DEC TCP/IP (UCX)
when executed over a TELNET connection.  Diagnosis: when the socket_read()
call was interrupted by an alarm/longjmp, subsequent calls to socket_read()
would fail with socket_errno 16, EBUSY, "mount device busy".  Cure: replace
the timer in netinc(), formerly alarm/signal/longjmp, with select().
Complication: the UCX programming environment did not include the necessary
header file, so the needed items (including copyright notice) had to be copied
from 4.4BSD /usr/include/sys/types.h.  Note: It would also be possible to add
select() for MultiNet, but it doesn't seem necessary; scripts, timeouts, etc,
work ok.  ckcnet.h, ckcnet.c 5A, 20 Nov 93.

Now that the VMS and OS/2 INPUT commands are fixed, I tried turning on
CK_BURST again (speedup for INPUT command by detecting bursts, code from Chuck
Goodheart at NASA).  It works in MultiNet on the Alpha.  It works in MultiNet
on the VAX.  It works in UCX on the VAX.  It works in UNIX.  It works in OS/2
on both serial and TCP/IP connections.  And it's fast.  Tested with many
services directory entries.  ckuus4.c, 20 Nov 93.

Added a new variable \v(cps), that tells the speed in characters per second of
the last protocol operation.  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c.  20 Nov 93.

Added a new function \fsize(filename), which returns the size of the given
file.  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c.  20 Nov 93.

Changed SHOW FUNCTIONS and SHOW VARIABLES not to list invisible items.
ckuus5.c, 20 Nov 93.

Peter Manzella at DEC noticed that MSEND commands could fail in VMS because of
a memory leak in ckuusr.c.  Solution: (1) increase the size of the buffer for
VMS from 1K to 4K (since it needs it, and can afford the memory); (2) plug the
memory leak.  The same thing could happen in UNIX as a result of
tilde-expansion.  ckucmd.h (CMDBL definition), ckuusr.c 5A(112), 20 Nov 93.

Added a trailing catch-all #else clause for the new CK_TMPDIR section in
the RECEIVE command, suggested by David Lane.  ckuusr.c, 20 Nov 93.

Changed SET KEY to allow { braces } around the key definition, like OUTPUT,
INPUT, ECHO, and other commands, to allow easier specification of strings
with leading and/or trailing blanks, and for consistency with all the other
commands.  ckuusr.c, 20 Nov 93.

Noticed that curses did not always do a great job of optimizing screen
writes, particularly in the "estimated time left" slot, so I added 3 lines
of code to screenc() so Kermit could optimize this itself.
ckuusx.c, 21 Nov 93.

From Kai Uwe Rommel, 21 Nov 93 (begin quote):

I have fixed the problems. Included I send a few diffs and a new ckotio.c,
because I took the opportunity for a few cleanups in this module.

I have also made changes to allow compilation with IBM's TCP/IP 2.0, which has
a 32-bit socket interface.  Unfortunately, this has the implication, that now
*two* DLL's are required, SO32DLL.DLL and TCP32DLL.DLL.  Also, the executable
doesn't run with TCP/IP 1.2.1 any longer.  So, we should make the distributed
32-bit executable for TCP/IP 1.2.1 and it also runs with TCP/IP 2.0.  I made
changes only to allow someone to recompile C-Kermit if he has only TCP/IP
2.0.  To fully support it, we will have to wait until I finally find the time
to restructure the TCP/IP support.

I have, BTW, dropped the IBMSELECT code, because it is not needed, both TCP/IP
1.2.1 and 2.0 support the BSD select() call and that is more portable.

Another problem: It is currently not possible to check for the return code of
programs run via zshcmd().  In addition, the exit code was not returned
correctly from zsyscmd() in the aegis and OS/2 cases.  I have somewhat quick-
fixed zshcmd() for the OS/2 case to allow the "IF FAIL" command to work.  The
UNIX branch has to be fixed too.  However, that only allows to check if the
return code is not zero.  Sometimes it would be convenient to determine the
exact exit code of the program.  How about adding a variable \v(exitcode)
which holds the return code of the last program run via zshcmd() or zsyscmd()?

My current wish list of things I would like to do looks like:
- Fix timed keyboard input with an additional thread instead of alarm()
- Restructure TCP/IP code to support multiple vendors with one executable
- Allow remote operation over serial lines and TELNET connections
- Add Tektronix emulation

(End quote)

Built 16- and 32-bit OS/2 versions OK, 21 Nov 93; put cko190.zip up for
testing on net.  All reactions so far are positive.

Another INPUT command speedup: Rather than always doing 1-second timed reads,
time each read for the amount of time left in given timeout interval.  This
reduces the number of system calls considerably, and still works fine --
succeeds when it should succeed, fails when it should fail, terminates
correctly under both extremes: no characters arriving at all; a steady stream
of characters arriving.  ckuus4.c 21 Nov 93.

Revisited old problem of UNIX and VMS CONNECT showing a couple garbage
characters upon first accessing a second or subsequent connection.  It was
just a matter of having the CONNECT module reset its i/o buffer pointers
whenever it knew it had a new connection, or that the current connection had
terminated because of an i/o error.  CKVCON.C (VMS) 5A(031), ckucon.c (UNIX)
5A(058), 23 Nov 93.

When transferring a file with packets longer than about 2300, debug() calls
would fail because the text to be logged was longer than the debug-record
buffer.  This made it tough to track down certain kinds of errors related to
long packets.  I changed the debug code to grow the buffer as necessary,
dynamically.  ckuusx.c, 24 Nov 93.

Moved closing of debug log to just before _exit() is called, so now we can log
the actions of ttres(), ttclos(), etc.  Reorganized UNIX ttclos() to not do a
lot of silly things to the command terminal, especially if it was using stdin
(file descriptor 0) to communicate with it.  ckutio.c, 24 Nov 93.

Added new WRITE-LINE (synonym: WRITELN) command.  Just like WRITE, except
it writes its argument string in the form of a line or record, appropriate to
the underlying operating system.  This lets scripts create output files
in a system-independent fashion.  ckuusr.c 5A(113), 24 Nov 93.

Change ttclos() in ckutio.c for UNIX to unset the TIOCSINUSE flag for the
device, since this bit had been set for it in ttopen().  I'm not sure if this
fixes any problem, but it shouldn't hurt.  Also, changed sysinit() to call
priv_ini() before doing anything else at all.  Apparently some UNIX versions
(386BSD, etc) won't allow a set[gu]id program to open /dev/tty to get the
terminal modes, etc, so this makes Kermit's effective UID be the user's real
UID before any attempt is made to get terminal modes, etc.  ckutio.c 5A(117)
24 Nov 93.

Removed "#define WAIT_T pid_t" from ckcdeb.h (within #ifdef POSIX).
Apparently, this is just completely wrong -- nowhere is the argument to wait()
a pid_t; it's always either an int or else a struct of some kind.  According
"Portable C Software", it's always safe to call wait() with an (int *).
ckcdeb.h 24 Nov 93.

Changed lockfile for 386BSD from /var/spool/uucp to /var/spool/lock --
suggested by many people.  makefile.

Changed ckhost(), the routine that gets the local host name, to call
gethostbyname() in 386BSD, rather than utsname().  Suggested by Nick Sayer
<mrappe@quack.kfu.com>, who says 386BSD (a.k.a. Jolix 0.1+pk0.2.4) didn't have
utsname().  ckuusx.c.

Chased down a report that SET DIAL INIT-STRING didn't work when invoked from
a macro.  As far as I can tell, it works fine.  However, SHOW DIAL did not
report your DIAL INIT-STRING or PREFIX if you had not previously SET MODEM to
something, which could be misleading.  ckudia.c 5A(051) 24 Nov 93.

The file attributes structure, zsattr, defined in ckcdeb.h, contained a member
called passwd.  But some C compilers can't deal with structure members having
the same names as other identifiers.  This killed C-Kermit compilation under
Altos Xenix 3.0.  Reported by Ken George <nsaho@tuns.ca>.  ck*fio.c, 24 Nov 93.

Fixed BSEND and TSEND macros in standard CKERMIT.INI file; they would mess
up if given wildcards.

Fixed SET HOST and TELNET commands to automatically SET CONTROL PREFIX 255
for TCP/IP connections.  This omission pointed out by Bill Glass.  ckuus7.c,
25 Nov 93.

INPUT commands, when executed from VMS C-Kermit in remote mode for reading
material from the console terminal (e.g. for checking terminal answerback
sequence), were not working right because the VMS version of coninc() did not
check to see if it timed out in certain cases and returned a character value
like 0 or 127 rather than -1 in these cases.  Fixed in coninc(), CKVTIO.C
2.0-064 25 Nov 93.

VMS C-Kermit session logs were being written in Stream_LF format, but still
contained carriage returns, which made them look funny when viewed in VMS
editors (little arrows showed up at the end of each line).  This was fixed by
opening the session log with "rfm=stm" (new) as well as "ctx=stm".  Suggested
by Jason Seaman <jason@wccf.mit.edu>, Whitaker College, MIT.  CKVFIO.C
2.0-105, 25 Nov 93.

Executing a series of file transfer commands from a command file or macro took
an inordinate amount of time because of long, annoying pauses between each
command.  It seems there were some gratuitous sleep(1)'s and sleep(2)'s in the
protocol module.  These were to allow "nonblocking" mode changes to take place
between command and protocol mode.  These sleeps really had no business in the
protocol module, and should be placed -- if necessary! -- in the appropriate
system-dependent modules.  Removing them makes multiple local-mode transfers
(send this, send that, send another, ...) go just as fast as a single wildcard
transfer.  For remote-mode transfers: same speedup, but you have to remember
to put SET DELAY 0 in your command file!  ckcpro.w 5A(057), ckutio.c 5A(118),
25 Nov 93.

Built today's version on SunOS 4.1.3, NeXTSTEP 3.0, Dell System V R4,
OpenVMS/VAX, OpenVMS/AXP, Linux 0.99.13, RS/6000 AIX 3.1, DEC OSF/1-AXP.

A couple minor adjustments for FreeBSD to yesterday's code from Scott Mace
<smace@freefall.cdrom.com>: declaration of sys_errlist[] in ckcfn3.c, SET
SPEED keyword list in ckuus3.c, vanity banner for FreeBSD.  While futzing with
the SET SPEED list yet again, I took the opportunity to redesign how it works.
Kermit-specific symbols are now defined (or undefined) in ckcdeb.h for the
uncommon speeds, and these can be augmented or overriden from the CC command
line using BPS_xxxx or NOB_xxxx symbols.  Also, added 57600 and 115200 for
Linux, and added an as-yet-unused entry for 230400 bps.  Documentation on
speed configuration added to ckccfg.doc.  26 Nov 93.

Added SET CONSOLE as an invisible synonym for SET COMMAND, as the word CONSOLE
is bit more intuitive, and in preparation for possibly adding other console-
related items, like SPEED, PARITY, FLOW, ...  ckuusr.c 5A(114) 26 Nov 93.

About 6-8 weeks ago, Paul Placeway sent in a new set of source for Macintosh
Kermit, in which several bugs were fixed in the Mac-specific (ckm*.*) modules,
and which had been adapted for compilation under Think C as well as MPW C.
These have now been adapted to C-Kermit edit 190, and I made several other
changes too: added a fix to doactive() from Ed Huff <huff@mcclb0.med.nyu.edu>,
apparently overlooked by Paul (?); I filled in the zhome() and zgtdir()
functions (code from Steven Woolgar <famus2@dmi.usherb.ca>); enabled the CD
and PWD commands as well as the corresponding functions and variables.  Some
changes to ckcdeb.h, ckuus5.c, ckuusr.c, ckcfns.c.  Compiles under MPW C 3.2
just fine, seems to run OK too, except CD command still pops up a bunch of
windows on the screen saying "Writing to the console in applications is NOT
supported!".  And zhome() always seems to return the null string.  And
zgtdir() always seems to return the name of the disk, but not the current
folder... (see code for these in ckmfio.c.)  26 Nov 93.

Added makefile entry for FreeBSD from Scott Mace <smace@freefall.cdrom.com>.
29 Nov 93.

Added SET PRINTER and SHOW PRINTER commands for OS/2 C-Kermit.  ckuusr.h,
ckuusr.c, ckuus2.c, ckuus3.c, ckuus5.c.  30 Nov 93.

ID swapping needed for access() in the BSDI version: -DSW_ACC_ID added to
the bsdi makefile entry.  From John Kohl.  1 Dec 93.

A fix from Kai Uwe Rommel for an OS/2 C-Kermit bug: if Kermit was left in
CONNECT mode, the OS/2 system could not be shut down.  ckotio.c 5A(110)
1 Dec 93.

Added SET { FILE, TERMINAL } CHARACTER-SET HP-ROMAN8, to support Hewlett
Packard's proprietary Latin-1-like 8-bit character set.  The translation used
is the one provided by HP (e.g. via iconv); it is not invertible.  Also, fixed
incorrect translation from DGI to Latin-2.  ckuxla.h, ckuxla.c 5A(021),
1 Dec 93.

Fixed TRANSLATE command to work right when one (or both) of the character-sets
is Latin-2 or CP852.  ckuus4.c, 1 Dec 93.

Changed terminal emulator in OS/2 C-Kermit to not display transparent-print
material on the screen, since this is how a real VT102 works.
ckocon.c 5A(106) 1 Dec 93.

Consolidated and rearranged some Mac-specific definitions and declarations:
ckcdeb.h, ckmusr.c, ckmtio.c, ckuus5.c, ckuus6.c.  The need for this was
pointed out by Joe Bearly <jst@itsa.ucsf.edu>.  1 Dec 93.

Fixed sdata() to make a special case for the Atari ST when looking to see
whether to interrupt the D-packet-sending loop, because the ST version of
ttchk() never returns a value > 1.  ckcfn2.c 5A(049) 1 Dec 93.

Changed the packet-mode interruption defaults from 2 Ctrl-C's to 3 Ctrl-C's.
This prevents protocol breakouts when users SET CONTROL UNPREFIX 3 or 131,
because 3 Ctrl-C's in a row will be encoded with a repeat count.  This change
might be a little disconcerting to users, but when they type two and nothing
happens, they will almost certainly type a third.  ckcmai.c, 2 Dec 93.

Added a new compile-time symbol: NDGPWNAM.  If you define this, e.g. in
CFLAGS or KFLAGS, it skips the forward declaration of getpwnam() in ckufio.c,
presumably because it was already declared in <pwd.h>, and avoid "conflicting
types for getpwnam" errors, e.g. from GCC 2.5.6.  ckufio.c 5A(077) 5 Dec 77.

The 32-bit version of OS/2 C-Kermit, when in server mode, failed to redirect
the output of REMOTE DIRECTORY, REMOTE TYPE, and similar commands (which work
by running a copy of CMD.COM via popen()), to the Kermit client.  Rather, the
output would appear on the server's screen.  This was caused by a bug in the
IBM C++ PDK Beta compiler which I have been using.  I upgraded to IBM C++ Set
2.0, and the problem went away.  8 Dec 93.

When Kai Uwe dropped the OS/2 C-Kermit IBM-style select() in favor of the BSD
version, he forgot to update ckotcp.c and ckotcp.def, so OS/2 C-Kermit would
no longer run on systems where IBM TCP/IP was not installed, because of a
dynamic linking error at startup time caused by _bsdselect missing from the
dummy DLL.  Kai Uwe to the rescue.  8 Dec 93.

Bo Kullmar noticed that SET TRANSFER CANCELLATION 3 3 does not quite make it
safe to SET CONTROL UNPREFIX 3.  This is because the code in ttinl() to check
for cancellation ignored the parity bit, so (for example) \x03\x83\x03 could
still kill a transfer.  I changed ttinl() to ignore the parity bit only if
PARITY was not NONE; this should be nearly 100% safe now that all C-Kermit
programs capable of remote-mode operation also do automatic parity detection.
Also, packet-mode interruption should occur only when C-Kermit is in remote
mode, but ttinl() was letting it happen in local mode too, so I changed it.
Also, I removed cancellation code from two C-Kermit programs that included it,
but that could never be in remote mode: Mac Kermit and Atari ST Kermit.
ck[9dlmsuv]tio.c, 9 Dec 93.  (OS/2 and Amiga Kermit were already OK.)

Added a new command-line option, -R (uppercase).  It is tied to a new IF
command, IF REMOTE-ONLY.  This allows us to skip all the local-mode setups
in the initialization files if we don't intend to use C-Kermit in local mode.
ckuusr.h, ckuus6.c, ckuusy.c, ckuus2.c, ckuus4.c.  Also, in making this
change, I discovered that prescan() did not handle bundled arguments
correctly; fixed in ckuus4.c.  ckuusr.c 5A(115), 9 Dec 93.

Edited the standard initialization file, CKERMIT.INI, to skip dial and
services directory setups if the -R command-line option given.  This makes
C-Kermit startup WAY faster.  Ditto for CKERMOD.INI.  9 Dec 93.

Fixed another bug discovered by Bo Kullmar, namely that the automatic
re-mallocation of the debug-log string buffer could make C-Kermit core dump
under certain circumstances.  I flushed this code and used sprintf() formats
to cut off the strings to fit in the buffer.  No more core dumps.  ckuusx.c,
9 Dec 93.

Michael Godfrey noticed that if a SET LINE command has been given (to open a
serial line), a subsequent TELNET command, given without a hostname/address,
acts like a CONNECT command on the serial line.  In OS/2 C-Kermit, which
starts up using COM1 by default, this usually gives a message like "No carrier
detected", which is not exactly what we want to say.  Now it gives an
appropriate error message.  ckuus7.c, 9 Dec 93.

Backed off on yesterday's debug-log change because it turns out sprintf()
field-width formats aren't portable after all.  Yesterday's change totally
broke debug logging on VMS.  Now we just decline to log any string that's
too big for the buffer.  ckuusx.c, 10 Dec 93.

One of the biggest problems with VMS C-Kermit was that it could not send
packets longer than MAXBUF (a SYSGEN parameter), nor longer than any of
various user quotas, such as BYTLM.  Attempts to do this resulted in SYS$QIOW
failing with error 28, Quota Exceeded (as finally revealed by the new and
improved debug log).  The low-level packet writer in VMS C-Kermit, ttol(), has
now been recoded to handle these errors more or (mostly) less gracefully: if a
write attempt fails with error 28, we chop the data in half and try again,
repeating until the write succeeds or the length goes below 70, at which point
we fail.  If the write succeeds, we remember the size for next time, so all
subsequent writes use it and bypass the trial-and-error rigamarole.  The
impact on performance is hardly noticeable, e.g. when sending 9000-byte
packets with MAXBUF = 2064.  So now we no longer have to tell VMS sites to
reconfigure and reboot their systems to solve this problem (though it is still
a good idea to have sufficient MAXBUF and BYTLM on systems where file transfer
is a commonplace activity).  Too see the new code in action, have VMS C-Kermit
send a file using 9K packets, with its debug log active, preferably on a
system with a small MAXBUF.  Then "search debug.log ttol" to see what happened
internally.  The packet sizes are not optimal: This could be achieved using a
binary-search trial-and-error technique, but it's not worth it -- the
performance difference is negligible.  CKVTIO.C 5A(067), 15 Dec 93.

Catch and ignore SIGDANGER in sysinit().  Suggested by Marc Pawliger,
<marc@sti.com>.  This code is enabled if SIGDANGER is defined.  As far as I
know, this holds true only on RS/6000 AIX.  The new code prevents C-Kermit
from being killed by AIX's swap-space police, except as a final resort.
ckutio.c 5A(120), 17 Dec 93.

The VMS version was not releasing the OPEN READ file descriptor, so successive
OPEN READ commands could use them up and then no further files could be
opened.  Noticed by Carl Friedburg, fixed by Terry Kennedy, ckvtio.c 5A(106),
22 Dec 93.

ESC/Tab keyword completion of R into RECEIVE did not work (as C does for
CONNECT and S for SEND).  Noticed and fixed by Mike Freeman
<mikef@pacifier.rain.com>, ckuusr.c, 27 Dec 93.

Added APC support to OS/2 C-Kermit's terminal emulator, and made various fixes
and speedups to it also.  ckocon.c 5A(107), ckuus4.c, 29 Dec 93.

Added SET TERMINAL APC { ON, OFF, UNCHECKED } to control execution of APC
commands received by C-Kermit.  Conditionalized all APC-execution-related code
under CK_APC, so it can easily be activated for the Macintosh too, or any
other C-Kermit implementation that has a built-in terminal emulator.  I might
even consider adding it to the UNIX and VMS versions, but for now, this
feature is activated only in the OS/2 version.
ckuus[r23457].c, ckuusr.h, 30 Dec 93.

Added automatic parity detection and DDK to OS/2 version.  This was done by
adapting UNIX ttinl() to OS/2, which is not the optimal solution.  My original
plan was to restructure the system-independent packet-reader, rpack(), to take
over the many functions that have been improperly delegated to ttinl() and, in
fact, to retire ttinl() altogether.  But this will be a much bigger job than
it seemed, because of the many and diverse ways in which the various ttinl()
versions handle timed reads, blocking vs nonblocking reads, buffering, etc.
We no longer allow the device driver to handle parity; like all other Kermit
programs, OS/2 C-Kermit now does this itself.  In particular, the ttsettings()
routine always sets no parity, 8 data bits.  ckotio.c, 5A(111) 30 Dec 93.

In adding parity detection to the OS/2 version, I discovered that it often
failed because, when looking at the packet control fields, it neglected to
strip the parity bit first, thus misinterpreting (in particular) the packet
length fields.  I migrated this fix into the UNIX, VMS, AOS/VS, and Stratus
versions.   ck[uvodl]tio.c, 31 Dec 93.

When using OS/2 C-Kermit's VT102 emulator with UNIX 'more', I discovered that
lines that were wrapped around the "more?" prompt caused the inverse video of
the "more?" prompt to extend to the right margin, but only when this occurred
at the bottom of the screen, i.e. when scrolling a wrapped line.  Experiments
showed this happening whenever scrolling any wrapped line that had nondefault
video attributes.  Diagnosis: the scroll() routine was creating the new bottom
line using the current attributes.  Cure: the scroll routine should use the
normal, default attributes to create the new bottom line, and then let
subsequent character-writing operations take care of the attributes.
ckocon.c, 5A(108) 4 Jan 94.

Added a new UNIX makefile entry for Amdahl UTSV with TCP/IP support, from
Gerald J. Werner, Marshfield Clinic <wernerg@dgabby.mfldclin.edu>.  5 Jan 94.

Installed new Stratus VOS modules: ckltio.c, cklfio.c, cklnet.c.  From David
Lane <David_Lane@vos.stratus.com>, 5 Jan 94.

Added print / dump screen to OS/2 C-Kermit.  Works in both the 32-bit and the
16-bit version.  Activate during CONNECT mode via Alt-P (or Alt-p), or by
<Escape-character>F/f as in MS-DOS Kermit.  Also had to add special code to
make it work for rolled-back screens.  Entries added to the two CONNECT-mode
help screens.  ckocon.c 5A(109), 6 Jan 94.

Fixed a screen-rollback bug in OS/2 C-Kermit, which occurred when a wrapped
line scrolled off the screen; the wrapped portion was not saved in the
rollback buffer.  The same thing happened with Index (ESC D); that's fixed
too.  ckocon.c 5A(109), 6 Jan 94.

Added TELNET NAWS (Negotiate About Window Size, RFC 1073) to the UNIX and OS/2
versions.  This feature is configured only if the program is built with the
CK_NAWS symbol defined.  Requires new system-dependent support routine,
ttgwsiz(), described in ckcplm.doc.  In UNIX C-Kermit, NAWS works only if the
TIOCGWINSZ symbol is defined and the corresponding ioctl is available and
executes without error.  Defined CK_NAWS by default for SunOS 4.1, NeXT,
System V R4, 4.4BSD, and OSF/1.  Override these default assignments by
including -DNONAWS on the CC command line.  I don't see how to do it for POSIX
or others, but people are encouraged to send in code to make it work for more
systems, or to confirm that it works safely on systems not yet included.
Note: Don't define CK_NAWS unless there is also a ttgwsiz() routine.
ckcnet.[ch], ckutio.c, ckocon.c, etc, 12 Jan 93.

Now that we know how to get the rows and colums of the controlling terminal,
we can change the various "more?"-prompting items to use the actual screen
length.  This includes the HELP command, SHOW MACROS, SHOW VARIABLES, etc.
ckuus[25].c, 12 Jan 93.  Later, this can also be extended to the file transfer
display screen and the command parser keyword and file menus.

Added SIGWINCH trapping for the UNIX version.  If you're running C-Kermit in a
window and you change the window size, UNIX delivers a SIGWINCH signal.
C-Kermit now catches this signal, asks UNIX what its new window size is, and
if a TELNET connection is open (and we have received permission to send NAWS
reports) we send a NAWS report.  Tested in NeXT Terminal window by stretching
the window during C-Kermit CONNECT mode, seemed to work fine for a while, but
then started to fall apart -- it seemed to interfere with some of the other
TELNET negotiations, like echoing.  But only when TELNET'ing from NeXT to
NeXT.  Removing the SIGWINCH code didn't make any difference.

Hmmm...  It seems the problem with the NeXT has nothing to do with NAWS.  Even
versions 188 and 189 had a similar problem, namely that the SIGUSR2 signal
which we use during CONNECT mode to let the lower fork tell the upper fork
about TELNET-negotiated echoing changes does not get delivered immediately,
and sometimes gets lost.  The reason the problem is only noticeable when going
from NeXT to NeXT is that the NeXT TELNET server sends many echoing changes,
rapid fire, and only the NeXT client is exhibiting the signal-delivery
sluggishness.

(Well, I spent two days on this one and could not solve it.  Then I discovered
that if I ran Kermit in a Stuart window rather than a Terminal window on the
NeXT, it worked perfectly.  It also works fine if I TELNET to the NeXT and
start Kermit in a TELNET session -- i.e. not in any kind of NeXT window.)

(This note inserted Aug 13, 1994: The changes that were made to the CONNECT
fork signalling in July-August 1994 have cleared all of this up, and now
C-Kermit can be used under Terminal just as well as under Stuart.)

Added CK_NAWS to VMS version.  Code for ttgwsiz() supplied by Mark Berryman
at SAIC.  CKVTIO.C 5A(069) 14 Jan 94.

Fixed a bug in the VMS version that I introduced when I moved the tn_ini()
call to be inside netopen(), which resulted in initial TELNET negotiations
never being sent.  ckcnet.c 5A(025) 14 Jan 94.

Added NOSIGWINCH symbol to allow SIGWINCH trapping be disabled without
disabling the NAWS feature itself.  ckccfg.doc, ckcnet.c, 14 Jan 94.

Fixed some dependencies in the UNIX makefile.  14 Jan 94.

Added NODISPO symbol to allow C-Kermit to be built to always refuse incoming
MAIL and REMOTE PRINT files.  ckcfn3.c, 14 Jan 94.

Jeff Altman <p00118@psilink.com> noticed that sequences of bold characters
would alternate between bold and regular.  The fix turned out to be rather
complicated, since it had to work for both normal and reverse-video screens,
and in working on this I discovered that the handling of DECSCNM, ESC [ ? 5
h/l, reverse-video/normal screen (i.e. the one that flips your entire current
screen between normal and reverse video), was totally broken.  Previously, it
would (a) only affect the rightmost 1/4 of an 80-column screen, and (b) it
wasn't "sticky" -- i.e. subsequently received characters would be displayed in
the opposite mode.  Much code was rewritten and tested successfully, and it
now works independently of your screen colors, etc.  ckocon.c 5A(112),
15 Jan 94.

Added additional printing capabilities to OS/2 C-Kermit's terminal emulator
via host-generated escape sequences.  All these are only for the 32-bit
version, since the 16-bit version crashes with a stack overflow if they are
used.  For the VT102 emulator:
 . ESC [ 0 i, print current screen (also ESC [ i).
 . ESC [ ? 1 i, print current line (i.e. the line where the cursor is).
 . ESC [ ? 19 h/l, select print extent (h = full screen, l = scrolling region).
   This applies when ESC [ 0 i or ESC [ i is received.

And for the VT52 emulator:
 . ESC V, print current line.
 . ESC ], print current screen.
 . ESC W, turn on transparent printing.
 . ESC X, turn off transparent printing.
 . ESC ^, autoprint on (treated like transparent print).
 . ESC _, autoprint off (treated like transparent print).

Implemented SRM (Send/Receive Mode), for host-controlled remote/local echo
in the VT102 emulator, ESC [ 12 h/l (h = remote echo, l = local echo).

Fixed VT52 reverse index.

Fixed an oversight in the new APC code, namely that if an APC, OSC, or similar
string-bearing escape sequence starts to arrive but never finishes, there was
no way to break the deadlock.  Now "reset terminal" (Alt-=) does it.

Restored host-directed switching between US and UK sets in VT102 emulation,
but ONLY if the terminal character-set is ASCII.  All other character-set
selections must be made by the user, via SET TERMINAL CHARACTER-SET.  That's
because this is a VT102, not a VT220 or higher, which allows the host to
control character-set designation and invocation.  ckocon.c 5A(112) 15 Jan 94.

After discussions with Jeffrey Altman about OS/2 C-Kermit, added a new
feature: SET { SEND, RECEIVE } PATHNAMES { ON, OFF }.  This applies to the
handling of filenames when SET FILE NAMES LITERAL is in effect.  SET SEND
PATHNAMES ON means to leave pathnames on outbound file names, which is the
default for compatibility with earlier behavior.  OFF means to strip path
information, leaving only the name.  SET RECEIVE PATHNAMES applies to the
filenames in incoming file header packets; ON means to leave the name alone
and attempt to use it as-is, OFF means to attempt to strip path information
ON THE ASSUMPTION that any path information found there would be in the
notation of the local file system.  If not, the results are unpredictable.
Use SHOW FILE to display the SEND/RECEIVE PATHNAME settings.
ckcmai.c, ckuus[r247].c, ckuusr.h, ckcfns.c, 16 Jan 94.

After the above, Jeffrey sent in new copies of ckcdeb.h, ckcfns.c, and
ckufio.c to allow OS/2 C-Kermit to accept incoming files that had long or
nonstandard names (e.g. mixed case, many periods), even on FAT file systems,
even when FILE NAMES LITERAL is in effect.  Before attempting to open the
file, C-Kermit checks to see if the name would be OK.  If not, it converts it
to a legal FAT (8.3) name.  ckcdeb.h; ckcfns.c 5A(096), ckufio.c 5A(078),
16 Jan 94.

Added CK_NAWS capability for AIX/6000 3.x, Solaris 2.x, Ultrix 4.x.
ckcnet.h, 16 Jan 94.

Kai Uwe Rommel sent in a fix for ckocon.c, for a problem I had noticed
earlier, namely that if you enter the OS/2 command processor directly from
CONNECT mode via <esc-char>!, then upon exit from OS/2 back to the C-Kermit
terminal screen, the entire screen would be blinking -- at least for me (but
not for Kai Uwe).  But even though he couldn't see it, he fixed it.
ckocon.c 5A(113), 16 Jan 94.

Added code to catch the case where the keyboard read() during CONNECT mode on
a TELNET connection is interrupted and returns 0 or -1, with errno == EINTR
(interrupted system call).  Previously, it would spuriously return
successfully with a random character.  Now it retries, up to 10 times, and
either fails or succeeds reliably.  ckucon.c 5A(059), 16 Jan 94.

From Jeffrey Altman, code for OS/2 version to create the directory for an
incoming file, if possible, when the incoming filespec includes directory
information.  ckotio.c 5A(112), ckufio.c 5A(078), ckcfns.c 5A(096), ckcdeb.h,
16 Jan 94.

Corrections from Jeff to yesterday's directory-creation code.  Also, the OS/2
version, upon receiving a file whose name is illegal for the FAT (DOS) file
system, will save the illegal name in the file's Extended Attributes before
creating the file with a valid FAT name.  Thus the "LongName" will still be
visible from the OS/2 desktop or when the file is copied to an HPFS volume.
EA stuff works only in the 32-bit version, since the MSC 6.00 compiler/linker
won't swallow it.  ckcfns.c 5A(097), ckufio.c 5A(079), 17 Jan 94.

Vincent Fatica <vefatica@mailbox.syr.edu> reported that OS/2 C-Kermit still
messed up "more" displays.  Turns out he was using a VT220 or higher terminal
type on the host and it was sending ESC [ Pn m sequences with Pn's (22-27)
that are not supported by the VT102; these turn off selected types of
highlighting individually: 22 = Turn Off Bold; 24 = Turn Off Underline;
25 = Turn off Blink; 27 = Turn Off Reverse Video.  These are now implemented,
and they work fine in all combinations.  ckocon.c 5A(117) 17 Jan 94.

HOWEVER, in getting this to work, and also as a result of fixing the
"whole-screen reverse/normal video" (DECSCNM) feature, I discovered that the
whole idea of having special user-selectable colors for reverse video was a
bad idea.  The code became horrendously tangled and big because of this, and
still many things didn't -- and could never -- work.  For example, it did not
take into account the host's ability to send color-changing commands per
character.  Nor, for that matter, the propensity of some video adapters to
interpret the "blink" bit as a background color change.  So from now on,
reverse video is reverse video; it simply swaps the fore- and background
colors.  Everything works right now; you can even display all the colors of
the ANSI spectrum, in all conceivable mixtures of attributes, flip the screen,
and flip it back again, with no loss or distortion of colors or attributes.

A new Alt key was added to flip the screen from the keyboard: Alt-R (Reverse
the Screen).  And a visual bell was added: SET TERMINAL BELL { AUDIBLE,
VISUAL, NONE }, as in MS-DOS Kermit.  ckuusr.h, ckuus2.c, ckuus7.c, ckocon.c,
17 Jan 94.

Jeff A. found out how to enable directory creation for the 16-bit OS/2 version
so I added that.  ckufio.c 5A(098) 18 Jan 94.

I made SET RECEIVE PATHNAME apply at all times, not just with SET FILE
NAMES LITERAL.  ckuus2.c, ckcfns.c 5A(080) 18 Jan 94.

Fixed OS/2 C-Kermit to strip off disk letters when sending files, except
when FILE NAMES are LITERAL *and* SEND PATHNAMES are ON.  ckcfns.c 5A(099),
19 Jan 94.

Added automatic directory creation to UNIX version.  Redesigned and rewrote
zmkdir(), added its specification to ckcplm.doc.  When an incoming file
includes a directory name in the file header packet, an attempt is made to
create the specified directory if SET RECEIVE PATHNAMES is ON.  In UNIX, any
directories that are created inherit the permissions of their parents, and the
owner and group of the user who is running the Kermit program.  Naturally,
directory creation fails if the user lacks the appropriate permissions.
ckcfns.c, ckufio.c 5A(081), 19 Jan 94.

Added skeleton of REXX command to the OS/2 version.  Jeff A will fill it
in.  To activate the REXX interface, define CK_REXX.  ckuusr.h, ckuusr.c,
ckuus3.c, ckuus4.c, 19 Jan 94.

Changed OS/2 version to send the system ID for OS/2, not UNIX!, in the
Attribute packet.  ckufio.c, 19 Jan 94.

In OS/2 version, added REXX and REXXFILE commands.  Jeffrey Altman filled in
the system-dependent execution thereof in ckotio.c, 5A(113), 20 Jan 94.
REXX executes a Rexx command.  REXXFILE executes a Rexx program from a file.
Both of these return the Rexx return code (a string) in the variable \v(rexx).
ckuusr.h, ckuusr.c 5A(117), ckuus2.c, ckuus3.c, ckuus4.c, 19 Jan 94.

Enabled SET FILE TYPE LABELED for OS/2.  Jeff Altman will fill in the
system-dependent code.  A new symbol, CK_LABELED, governs this feature now;
previously it was dependent on VMS.  LABELED transfers will allow OS/2 files
to be sent with all their attributes, either for direct use on another OS/2
system, or for archival on a non-OS/2 system.  ckcfn3.c, ckuus4.c, ckuusx.c,
20 Jan 94.

Added code to append ".~number~" to the OS/2 longname in the extended
attributes block whenever we rename a file using znewn().  ckcfns.c 5A(100),
20 Jan 94.

Changed OS/2 C-Kermit to *never* send a disk letter, regardless of FILE
NAMES or SEND PATHNAMES settings.  (Of course, you can still send a disk
letter in an "as-name").  ckcfns.c 5A(100) 20 Jan 94.

Fixed OS/2 C-Kermit's terminal emulator to preserve brightness of foreground
colors selected by SET TERMINAL COLOR.  This feature was destroyed in the
edits of January 17.  Blinking, however, still does not work right, and so
is simulated by a high-intensity background.  ckocon.c 5A(115), 21 Jan 94.

Disabled Rexx features in 16-bit OS/2 version, because MSC can't cope with
the rexxsaa.h header file.  21 Jan 94.

Added a small modification to ttopen() for POSIX-based Lynx OS 2.2, in which
file descriptor zero is read-only rather than read-write, from Simon Park
<si@wimpol.demon.co.uk>, plus a new makefile entry for this system.
ckutio.c 5A(123), 24 Jan 94.

Replaced the previous HP Roman-8 / Latin-1 character translation tables, which
were not invertible, by new invertible tables, approved by HP.
ckuxla.c 5A(022), 24 Jan 94.

Added a new variable, \v(newline), that contains the appropriate newline
character or sequence for each system where C-Kermit runs (UNIX = LF,
MAC = CR, OS/2 = CRLF, etc).  Use this when writing script programs that
output data to a file and you need to terminate lines in a system-independent
way.  I considered making this a simple backslash escape, \n, but this could
have wreaked havoc with existing scripts in which \n simply quoted the "n"
character.  ckuusr.c 5A(118), 24 Jan 94, ckuus4.c, ckuus5.c.

Created a new routine, domac(name,definition).  Call it with a macro name
and definition string, and it defines the macro and executes it.  This is
now called by the APC code in the CONNECT command, but it is also usable
in any other context.  Works OK with APC.  This will soon be used also to allow
OS/2 Rexx programs to execute Kermit commands.  ckuus5.c, 24 Jan 94.

Integrated Jeff Altman's new code supporting OS/2 Extended Attributes in
SET FILE TYPE LABELED operations.  In other words, now you can actually use
SET FILE TYPE LABELED to transfer OS/2 files, just as you can with VMS files.
ckufio.c, etc etc.  24 Jan 94.

Jeff Altman filled in the function that exports C-Kermit commands to Rexx.
So now you can run a Rexx program under Kermit and the Rexx program can
execute Kermit commands.  Rexx support is still activated only in the 32-bit
version, due to problems with the 16-bit libraries.
ckotio.c 5A(115), 25 Jan 94.

Removed OS/2 Extended Attribute support from 16-bit OS/2 version, since it
could not be compiled with MSC.  Ditto labeled file transfer.
Many modules, 25 Jan 94.

Added SET FILE LABEL {ARCHIVE, READ-ONLY, HIDDEN, SYSTEM, EXTENDED} {ON, OFF}
so user can include (ON) or exclude (OFF) the given attributes when
transferring OS/2 files in LABELED mode; 32-bit version only.  By default all
but ARCHIVE are ON.  ckcmai.c 5A(190), ckcdeb.h, ckuusr.c 5A(119), ckuus2.c,
ckuus5.c, ckuus7.c, ckcfns.c 5A(102), ckcfn3.c, 25 Jan 94.  Labeled file
option bits are passed in the lblopts member (a bit mask) of the filinfo
struct.  The low-level ckufio.c routines still need the OS/2-specific code to
handle them, and the format of the OS/2 labeled file needs to be expanded to
include them.

Jeff Altman suspected there might be a memory leak somewhere in the DIAL
command, so I went through it thoroughly to make sure that all writes into
buffers were checked in advance against overflow, and that all malloc'd items
were free'd before returning.  Found several cases where these actions were
not taken previously, so memory leaks were definitely possible, especially
when a phone number or a device name was VERY long.  ckudia.c 5A(052),
29 Jan 94.

Harvey Stein at Hebrew University pointed out that there was no way to have
C-Kermit dial from a command file before the prompt was issued, and still be
able to interrupt dialing and get to the prompt.  It seems that the rules for
command order listed on "Using C-Kermit", p.323, were not being followed.  It
should have been possible to interrupt '-C "command list"' execution and get
back to the prompt, but it wasn't.  So I moved a block of code.
ckcmai.c 5A(190), 29 Jan 94.

Discovered that on at least one operating system, SunOS 4.x, C-Kermit's
lowest-level command parsing function -- gtword() in ckucmd.c -- was failing
to detect "end of file" when commands were coming from redirected standard
input (e.g. "kermit < foo").  Debugging showed that errno was being set to
EINTR for some unfathomable reason, which was being explicitly checked for as
an exception to EOF detection, because it could occur when a backgrounded
C-Kermit was re-foregrounded.  So I added a counter to break out of the
infinite loop that results from this situation.  ckucmd.c 5A(054), 30 Jan 94.

Noticed that if you start up UNIX Kermit with "&" so it is in the background
initially, then the command parser doesn't work right after putting it in the
foreground.  In this case, Kermit was not able to get its console modes when
it started up, so concb() was not able to modify them for "cbreak" mode.
Solution: If concb() is called when the original console modes are not yet
available, AND we know we are not in the background, then try to get the
console modes before giving up.  concb(), ckutio.c 5A(124), 30 Jan 94.

Added automatic command retry.  If at interactive prompting level, a command
has a syntax error, the next prompt will include the fields that were correct
(if any); for example:

  C-Kermit>set block foo
  ?No keywords match - foo
  C-Kermit>set block _

(where "_" shows the position of the cursor).  ckuus5.c, 30 Jan 94.

Added command recall.  It is enabled if DCMDBUF is defined, since it makes
liberal use of malloc().  To recall a command, type Ctrl-P (familiar to EMACS
users) or Ctrl-B (familiar to VMS users).  Repeatedly doing this moves up in
the command history buffer, up to the top.  Ctrl-N moves back down.  Effective
only for interactive-mode commands.  Tested on UNIX, OS/2, VMS -- should work
everywhere, not system-dependent at all (as it would be, for example, if we
allowed arrow keys to be used for this purpose!).
ckucmd.c 5A(054), 30 Jan 94.

Added SET COMMAND RECALL-BUFFER-SIZE command, to let the user establish the
size of the rollback buffer.  ckuusr.h, ckuus3.c.  ckuusr.c 5A(120), 30 Jan 94.

Added SHOW COMMAND to display SET COMMAND items.  ckuus5.c, 30 Jan 94.

Updated general and specific help texts.  ckuus2.c, ckuus6.c, 30 Jan 94.

Changed OS/2 CONNECT command to print the error status code if it gets
an i/o error.  ckotio.c 5A(117), ckocon.c 5A(116), 2 Feb 94.

Added some parens around "if" conditions in gattr() in ckcfn3.c to force
the IBM OS/2 C++ compiler to use the right precedence.  2 Feb 94.

The change to allow Ctrl-P in OS/2 C-Kermit during command parsing
broke Ctrl-C interruption.  So now we go back to how it was before:
Ctrl-C works again, Ctrl-P is likely to be ignored (or toggle the printer).
ckotio.c 5A(118), 3 Feb 94.

Ric Anderson pointed out a problem with the RENAME command in UNIX and OS/2,
namely that it would hang forever (until user typed Ctrl-C) if the new name
was the name of an already-existing directory.  Reason unknown, but the
solution went approximately like this:

 1. Change cmofi() (parse output filename) to return 2 if user types the
    name of an existing directory.  This allows anybody who calls cmofi()
    to decide whether to handle directory-changing, or just diagnose an error.
    ckucmd.c 5A(055) 5 Feb 94.

 2. Changed zrename(old,new) to "do the right thing" if the second argument
    is the name of an existing directory, i.e. move the old file into it.
    Also changed zchko(name) to fail if given the name of an existing
    directory.  ckufio.c 5A(083) 5 Feb 94.

This also allowed simple checking in the higher-level command-parsing routines
for when users gave a directory name when an output file name was required,
e.g. in the various LOG commands, etc.

Applied patches to IBM OS/2 C/C++ compiler, bringing it up to Service Level
CT00006.  Hard to say yet what good this did, but it did not fix the Ctrl-C
during DIAL problem (at least not for me).

OS/2 C-Kermit's SET FILE COLLISION UPDATE feature was not working very well.
For example, If I download (say) 45 different files, and then I tell OS/2
C-Kermit to SET FILE COLLISION UPDATE, and then download the exact same set of
files (without having touched any of them in the meantime), OS/2 C-Kermit
failed to reject about 50% of them.  It appears that OS/2 stat(), when asked
for the file's modification date/time, always returns an even number (which is
strange, because the OS/2 DIRECTORY command shows odd-numbered seconds).
Thus, many incoming files will appear to be newer than the OS/2 files that are
exact copies of them.  So I added OS/2-specific code to zstime() in ckufio.c
to ignore a one-second difference if the local modification time is an even
number.  5 Feb 94.

I finally tracked down what was killing typeahead in the interactive command
parser: the call to concb() that preceded each command in the main loop of the
parser() function.  Although concb() does not explicitly clear the keyboard
input buffer, apparently it does this as a side effect of setting modes.  In
fact, this call to concb() was unnecessary, since the console is already put
into cbreak() mode upon entry to the parser() function, and also by popclvl()
whenever the command stack pops back to top level.  So now typeahead works
between interactive commands, but it still can't be done while a command
file or macro is active.  That's because a command file or macro might
itself request keyboard input, or go into CONNECT mode, or go into protocol
mode.  ckuusr.c 5A(121), ckuus5.c, 6 Feb 94.

The DIAL command (dodial() in ckuus6.c) was changed to save the current parity
(which might have just been picked up from a dialing directory entry) and set
the parity to NONE before calling the actual DIAL module, ckdial() in ckudia.c,
and then to restore the parity when after ckdial() returns.  Since ckudia.c
has its own internal SIGINT trap, this works even if the DIAL command is
interrupted.  This change should facilitate dialing with the new breed of
buggy modems that is sensitive to parity, as well as dialing through TCP/IP
TELNET modem servers.  Lots of testing needed!  ckuus6.c, 6 Feb 94.

Also, found one place in the ckdial() function where it was returning
after having set up some signal()s without calling dreset() to put them
back.  Maybe this explains the crashes when typing Ctrl-C while dialing.
ckudia.c 5A(053), 6 Feb 94.  (Later: No, it doesn't -- the program still
crashes consistently on OS/2 if you Ctrl-C a DIAL command that is trying
to dial a modem that is not turned on.)

It has bothered me for years that END and RETURN can't serve their normal
functions when used in the command-list of a FOR, WHILE, or XIF command,
simply because these three commands are implemented as macros themselves.  Now
they do work as expected.  A small piece of code was added to each command,
which, before popping the command stack from the current level (macro or TAKE
file), looks to see if the currently executing macro (if any) is one of these
commands, and if so, pops the command stack twice and copies the macro
arguments up two levels (_putargs), and keeps doing this until it encounters a
command level in which none of these commands is executing, and therefore
works correctly with nested XIF/WHILE/FOR commands in any combination.  Tested
fairly extensively, but obviously more widespread testing is needed.  New
cketest and ckedemo files created to exercise this feature.  ckuusr.c,
ckuus6.c, 6 Feb 94.

Bo Kullmar noticed that two Ctrl-N's were required to get a new command
when reversing command recall direction.  Actually, the same was true when
going from down to up (two Ctrl-P's needed).  Fixed, in a rather dumb way,
in ckucmd.c 5A(056), 6 Feb 94.

Extended dialing parity business from yesterday to mdmhup() routine, the
one that escapes back to the modem and gives a modem-specific hangup command.
ckudia.c 5A(054), 7 Feb 94.

Updated OS/2 code from Jeff Altman:
 . SET FILE TYPE LABELED now includes regular (DOS) attributes.
 . Rexx functions finished up.
 . Documentation provided.

Added UNIX makefile entry for Bull DPX/2 BOS/X.  7 Feb 94.

Fixed "invisible" attribute handling in OS/2 C-Kermit terminal emulator,
and enabled handling of the (undocumented) DEC VT220 escape sequence,
CSI 28 m, "turn off invisible selectively", after verifying that this works
on a real DEC VT320 terminal.  Also, radically simplified handling of the
invisible attribute and removed lots of complicated code -- Joe Doupnik's
idea: if we're invisible mode, just write any graphic character as a space.
ckocon.c 5A(118), 8 Feb 94.

Added an optional "switch", /QUIETLY, to the CONNECT command, to skip the
verbose CONNECT message.  ckuusr.h, ckuusr.c 5A(122), ckuus4.c, 8 Feb 94.

Implemented SET DEBUG SESSION in OS/2 C-Kermit.  Forces TERMINAL WRAP ON.  C0
control characters are shown as corresponding letters in the underline color,
e.g. Ctrl-A is shown as underline A.  DEL is shown as underline question mark.
C1 controls are shown as IBM PC characters from code page columns 8 and 9, but
in underline color.  All other characters are shown as-is.  TELNET
negotiations are written out in words, one per screen line (a change from
before, when they were all run-on).  ckocon.c, ckcnet.h, ckcnet.c 5A(027),
8 Feb 94.

Added SET TERMINAL DEBUG { ON, OFF } as a synonym for SET DEBUG SESSION.
ckuusr.c, ckuusr.h, ckuus5.c, ckuus7.c, 8 Feb 94.  Also added this to SHOW
TERMINAL display.

Added Alt-D to OS/2 C-Kermit's terminal emulator to toggle debugging on and
off, and added an indication to the status line.  ckocon.c, 8 Feb 94.

Fixed a bug in the OS/2 C-Kermit terminal emulator, in which it would escape
back to the prompt if it received an APC sequence, even if APC was OFF.
ckocon.c, 8 Feb 94.

Added another keyboard ID to OS/2 C-Kermit's \v(keyboard) list.  ckotio.c
5A(121), 8 Feb 94.

Enabled VT100 and VT220 emulation in OS/2 C-Kermit.  The VT220 emulation is
not complete, but here's what we have so far:

 . You can now SET TERMINAL TYPE { VT52, VT100, VT102, VT220 }.
 . Kermit will identify itself accordingly in response to DECID or DA.
 . SHOW TERMINAL shows the current terminal type and ID string.
 . VT100 is exactly like VT102 except no character insert/delete.
 . 8-bit controls (like CSI = 155) are now accepted, but you must SET TERMINAL
   BYTESIZE 8 (and, of course, SET PARITY NONE) in order for them to work, and
   you also must set your terminal character-set to something other than
   TRANSPARENT or any of the IBM code pages or other sets that put graphic
   characters in the C1 area.  C1 controls are handled by converting them (in
   just one place: the rdserwrtscr() routine) to their 7-bit escape-sequence
   equivalents internally -- thus session logging, debug display, etc, will
   not reveal them; e.g. CSI shows up as "ESC [".  This was a cheap approach,
   but it works fine except for the logging.
 . If SET TERMINAL ANSWERBACK is ON, C-Kermit now includes terminal-type name
   in the answerback string, e.g. "OS/2 C-Kermit 501190 VT220".
 . The VT220 extensions added earlier take care of the most common needs
   of VT220-and-above applications; tests mostly OK with EDIT/TPU (EVE) on
   VMS, but more work needed to fill in some higher-level escape sequences
   that are not yet handled: character-set designation & invocation, 
   many reports, etc.

ckocon.c, ckuus5.c, ckuus7.c, 8 Feb 94.

Added nextfat UNIX makefile entry from Ronald C.F. Antony <rcfa@cubiculum.com>;
generates a NeXTSTEP binary that will run on both Intel and Motorola platforms.
14 Feb 94.

Found and fixed the problem in the OS/2 C-Kermit VT terminal emulator with
EDT/TPU (EVE): Erase In Display (ED), CSI Pn J, was being handled incorrectly.
Although the VT terminal manuals don't say it, this sequence sets cleared
cells to the default attributes, not to the prevailing attributes -- verified
by experimentation on real VT terminals.  Now EDT/TPU works nicely, even in
VT220 mode on an 8-bit connection with 8-bit controls.  ckocon.c 5A(119),
14 Feb 94.

A couple minor syntactic corrections to ckcnet.c and ckotio.c.  14 Feb 94.

Fixed a bad bug noticed by Carlo@sg.tn.tudelft.nl: SET MODEM HAYES (or other),
SET LINE whatever, HANGUP, before a DIAL command had been given, would crash
the program (if it was compiled with the DYNAMIC option) because the modem
response buffer had not been malloc'd yet.  ckudia.c, 15 Feb 94.

Minor correction to ckuus6.c from Steve Walton -- IF REMOTE parsing code
needed to be in #ifdef CK_IFRO..#endif.  15 Feb 94.

Added VT220 DECDSR reports to OS/2 C-Kermit's terminal emulator: printer
status, keyboard dialect.  Now all VT220 reports are supported except
DECDSR/UDK ... 15 Feb 94.

Some minor cleanups -- and LOTS of testing -- of VMS version, especially
when running under DCL.  15 Feb 94.

Added DECDSR/UDK report response to OS/2 C-K VT220 emulator -- it always
replies "UDKs are locked".  16 Feb 94.

Looked into changing VMS C-Kermit to use SYS$COMMAND rather than SYS$INPUT
as the designator for the console device.  This would allow DCL command
procedures to use the CONNECT command even when they did not DEFINE
SYS$INPUT to be SYS$COMMAND.  However, this prevents the command parser from
reading from SYS$INPUT, and therefore prevents the use of "image data" in
DCL command procedures, which would throw most VMS users for a loop.
Conceivably, we could separate the command input from the CONNECT input, but
this would require massive recoding.  Deferred.

Looked into adding user-defined modem hangup strings, similar to SET DIAL
INIT-STRING, etc.  Not easy, because we have not only the string itself to
deal with, but also the escape sequence and guard time; thus we would need
at least 3 or 4 new SET COMMANDS, assuming the Hayes model (pause, +++,
pause, ATH0 or whatever).  And this doesn't even take into account the
method to be used for reading the response.  Deferred.  17 Feb 94.

In view of persistent (and confirmed) reports of C-Kermit crashing on certain
systems (VMS, OS/2), but not others (UNIX), when DIAL commands fail, or when
they are interrupted, I ripped out (a) the "failure-within-a-failure" handler
from ckudia.c, which had nested setjmps, alarms, and signals, and whose
purpose I really never understood (it's Herm Fischer's code from 10 years
ago).  I also removed the Microm modem code that did similar things, and
replaced it with simple, straightforward (input, output) code.  The Microcom
code crashed consistently on VMS.  ckudia.c 5A(156), 18 Feb 94.  This change
didn't do any good at all, foo.

Added SET COMMAND RETRY { ON, OFF }, because one edit 190 previewer complained
that this feature interfered with DCL wrappers he had written for Kermit,
which parsed error messages, etc.  ckuus[235].c, 18 Feb 94.

Fixed command retry to account for variables used in commands, which can
change size during parsing, thus giving partial or garbage fields in the retry
prompt.  Problem noticed by Jeff Altman.  ckuus5.c, 19 Feb 94.

Changed SET KEY to allow inclusion of \K verbs, in the same manner as the
OUTPUT command allows \B or \L to be included, without losing the backslash.
Ditto for \{Kverb}.  All \Kverb-related material is enclosed in
#ifndef NOKVERB..#endif.  ckuus3.c, 19 Feb 94.

Added keyboard verb handling to OS/2 C-Kermit.  Routine sendcharduplex() split
into two routines: (1) sendescseq(), used to send DEC special keys, and (2)
sendkeydef(), used to send user-defined key macros.  sendkeydef() looks for
\Kverbs (including \K{verbs}) and executes them.  New routine dokverb() does
the actual execution.  A new header file, ckocon.h, was added to define
symbols for the keyboard verbs, as well as a table associating the verbs with
their symbols.  ckocon.[ch] 5A(120), 19 Feb 94.

Filled in dokverb() with a few easy verbs: \Kbreak, \Kexit, \Klbreak, \Kdump,
\Knull, \Kreset, \Kignore.  Works fine.  Added DEC F keys, DEC editing keys,
DEC cursor keys, all other DEC key groups except UDKs, the rest of the Kermit
action verbs, etc.  Moved a lot of code out of vt100key(); now it's in
dokverb(), which can be called from various places.

All functions previously available are still available, but rather than being
tied to hardwired scan codes, they are tied to \Kverbs.  This means:
 . You can move them anywhere you want.
 . You can't "lose" them, as you could before if you mapped something else
   over a sacred key, and therefore you can redefine sacred keys.
 . That is, NO keys are sacred; no keys are preempted by Kermit in any
   way that you can't overcome; you can undefine/redefine any and all keys.
 . Key mapping files now contain descriptive verbs rather than magic numbers
   as the definitions.
 . SHOW KEY shows the \Kverb, rather than obscure numeric cross-reference.

Furthermore:
 . The \Kverbs are totally compatible with MS-DOS Kermit (even though
   the scan codes are not!)
 . You can combine characters, strings, and \Kverbs arbitrarily in a
   key definition; e.g. you can put two or more verbs on key, etc.

Examples (for F1):
 . set key \315 \161             ; Any single character
 . set key \315 Any string       ; Any string of ordinary characters
 . set key \315 { Any string }   ; String with leading & trailing spaces
 . set key \315 \KupArr          ; Up-Arrow
 . set key \315 \KupArr\KrtArr   ; Up-Arrow and Right-Arrow
 . set key \315 abc\{KupArr}xyz  ; "abc", then Up-Arrow, then "xyz"
 . set key \315 abc\KupArr xyz   ; "abc", then Up-Arrow, then " xyz"
 . set key \315 \v(time)         ; Time when SET KEY was exucuted (constant)
 . set key \315 \\v(time)        ; Time when key is pressed (variable)

Braces are not required except to resolve ambiguity or to preserve leading
and/or trailing spaces in the definition.  Note that \\v(name) is a special
case.  Other backslash quantities cannot have their evaluation postponed by
"double quoting" in this way; they are simply emitted literally, e.g.
"set key \315 \\%a" causes F1 to send "\%a".

User-defined macros are not supported -- the code's there, but it doesn't
work yet.

Rollback now works differently.  Previously, you could only look at rolled
back screens, but you couldn't do any work in them; while rolled back, only
the rollback keys were operative (except for a horrible hack that let you
print/dump a rolled-back screen).  You couldn't type any of the special keys,
like pop-up help, or Alt-x to get back, etc, and you couldn't transmit any
characters to the host, which was a big pain, because you often want to be
looking at rolled-back material when typing stuff to the host.  Also,
arriving characters were not displayed until unrolled all the way down to
bottom.  Now, all of these restrictions are lifted.

The following \Kverbs are supported:

 (About 70 of them; I'll fill this in later; for now, see ckocon.h.)
 (Basically, there's a verb for every DEC key, like PF4, Gold, Select,
 F20, arrow keys, keypad keys, etc, and each of these verbs tracks the
 terminal type, keypad mode, etc, dynamically, just like in MS-DOS Kermit.)
 (Plus all the Kermit action verbs, like \Kexit, \KupScn, etc...)

The default key mapping is:

 Key           Function     Description
 Scroll Lock   \KholdScrn   Hold Screen
 Up Arrow      \KupArr      DEC up arrow 
 ...
 (I'll fill this in later; for now see macrotabini() in ckocon.c; the
 default mapping is about the same as before.)

The major casualty in all this is the status line and the pop-up help screen.
There is no way of knowing what verbs are mapped to which keys without doing
an exhaustive search of all keys and looking for substrings, plus some verbs
might be mapped to more than one key, etc.  Plus even if we do find the key
that, say, \Kexit is assigned to, we still don't have an easy way to translate
the scan code into "English", especially given the fact that -- hopefully --
the scan codes will change to become compatible with MS-DOS Kermit.

Still to do:

 . Add \v(rows), \v(columns).
 . Add compose-key feature.
 . Implement user-defined keys (UDKs, in the VT220 sense).
 . Add macro execution (\Kfoo, where foo is a user-defined macro).
 . Do something about mode-line and alt-help screen; presently these
   still contain the hardwired Alt-key legends, which will not be true
   if you change the key assignments.

And finally (I was hoping to enlist Kai Uwe's help with this one), it would
be very nice to have OS/2 C-Kermit differentiate among more key combos,
like Alt-x and Alt-Shift-X, and, in fact, to have its scan codes compatible
with MS-DOS Kermit's, so the two programs can share key settings files.

And, finally + 1, to illustrate just the VT220 keyboard setup, there's a
complete key settings that incorporates all VT220 features (I think):
it's in ~kermit/test/ckovtk2.ini.

Corrected SHOW TERM -- it had arrow-key modes reversed.  ckocon.c, 24 Feb 94.

Fixed OS/2 C-Kermit TELNET terminal-type negotiations to send the name of
the terminal currently being emulated.  ckcnet.c 5A(028).

Rearranged the error-handling code in DIAL module, ckudia.c.  Persistent
reports of crashes during dialing were traced (mostly thanks to hints from
Mark Berryman) to the fact that the code (inherited from H. Fisher, circa 1985)
was doing longjmps to places that were not on the call stack.  Apparently,
most UNIX C compilers go out of their way to accommodate this situation, but
on OS/2 and VMS we have guaranteed disaster.  To aid in debugging, I also
added timestamps to certain messages that are shown if DIAL DISPLAY is ON.
I also cleaned up some of the the other messages and made them more consistent.
ckudia.c 5A(057), 25 Feb 94.

Preliminary results look good.  All of these would cause crashes previously
under VMS and OS/2:
                                                 OS/2  VMS   UNIX
  SET MODEM MICROCOM and DIAL                     OK    OK    OK
  DIAL on a Hayes modem that's turned off         OK    OK    OK
  DIAL on a Telebit modem that's turned off       OK    OK    OK
  Ctrl-C before init message                      OK    OK    OK
  Ctrl-C after init message                       OK    OK    OK
  Ctrl-C after dialing message                    OK    ??    OK

One small problem remains: Interrupting VMS C-Kermit DIAL commands repeatedly
sometimes makes it EXIT (just as though the EXIT command had been given).

Added code from <carlo@sg.tn.tudelft.nl> to enable high serial speeds for
Linux.  ckutio.c 5A(125), 26 Feb 94.

Fixed a bug that caused two consecutive "Up" (Ctrl-P or Ctrl-B) commands,
when given at the top of the command recall buffer, to crash the program.
Reported by Marko Teittinen <marko@cs.umd.edu>.  ckucmd.c 5A(057), 26 Feb 94.

From Carlo Kid at the Technical University of Delft <carlo@sg.tn.tudelft.nl>,
fixes for the INPUT command.  It spuriously matched the first character of the
search string except it was also the first character received.  Thus "input 5
oofa" would not match "sofa" (right) but would match "blah sofa" (wrong).
Second, when backing up through previously received characters to restart a
search, it did not always back up to the right place.  ckuus4.c, 26 Feb 94.

Also from Carlo Kid: a new command, MINPUT - "multiple input".  He supplied
the code for the actual string matching, as well as command-parsing code,
etc.  I kept his string-matching code (doinput() routine in ckuus4.c) pretty
much as-is, but totally rewrote the command parsing.

Syntax: MINPUT <sec> [ string1 [, string2 [, string2 [, ... ] ] ] ]

Works just like the INPUT command, except more than one search string is
allowed.  Strings are separated by commas.  If any of the search strings is
encountered within the timeout interval, the command succeeds and the
\v(minput) variable is set to the number of the string that was found: 1, 2,
3, etc.  If none of the search strings is found, the command times out,
fails, and \v(minput) is set to 0.  All SET INPUT paramaters apply - CASE,
etc.  Example:

  minput 30 Login:, Username:, Ready
  if success goto LBL\v(minput)
  end 1 Prompt didn't arrive.

Looks for any of the three strings "Login:", "Username:", or "Ready" and
then goes to one of the labels "LBL1", "LBL2", or "LBL3", depending on which
string was matched.

To include a comma in a string, enclose it in { braces }, or quote the comma
with two (yes, two) backslashes:

  minput 20 {a,b}, c
  minput 20 a\\,b, c

Both of these commands search for either "a,b" or "c".

As in the regular INPUT and REINPUT commands, leading and trailing spaces are
stripped from each search string unless it is enclosed in { braces }.
Example:

  minput 20 {  abc  }, {{ def }},    ghi

searches for "  abc  ", "{ def }", or "ghi".

This feature is included in C-Kermit if (a) NOMINPUT is not defined,
and (b) NOSPL is not defined.  So by default, all versions that include the
script programming language get the MINPUT command.
ckuusr.c 5A(125), 26 Feb 94; ckuusr.h, ckuus2.c, ckuus4.c.

Added zmkdir() for VMS, contributed by Mark Berryman of SAIC
<Mark.Berryman@Mvb.Saic.Com>.  Defined CK_MKDIR for VMS, thus enabling all
of the directory-creation code.  ckcdeb.h, ckvfio.c 2.0-107, 26 Feb 94.

Installed another new LIBCMU from Mike O'Malley.  26 Feb 94.

Changed OS/2 INSTALL.CMD (CKOINS.CMD) to use CKOVTK2.INI rather than
CKOVTK.INI.  Updated OS/2 READ.ME (CKOAAA.DSK) file.  27 Feb 94.

Found and plugged a tiny (1-byte) memory leak in the INPUT command.
ckuus4.c, 27 Feb 94.

In OS/2 C-Kermit, changed default VT cursor key mode to be "normal" (cursor)
rather than "application", and default keypad mode to be "numeric" rather than
"application", in accordance with power-up state of real DEC terminals.
ckocon.c 5A(121), ckuus5.c, ckuus7.c, 27 Feb 94.

Added a call to setcursormode() to doreset() in ckocon.c.  This fixes the
screen if it goes into all-blinking mode, which can happen if you have a
high-intensity background color and Alt-Esc back to the workplace shell,
and then resume Kermit.  Now Alt-= (\Kreset) stops the blinking.  ckocon.c,
27 Feb 94.

Fixed OS/2 C-K's treatment of "Linefeed/Newline Mode".  On a real terminal,
this is controlled by the host via CSI 20 h/l (h = set, l = reset).  This
sequence (LNM) affects both sending (when set, Return and Enter send CRLF) and
receiving (when set, LF, FF, VT are displayed as CRLF).  But Kermit can
control the sending and receiving aspects separately via SET TERMINAL
NEWLINE-MODE and SET TERMINAL CR-DISPLAY.  ckocon.c previously used one
variable (linemode) for LNM, and two others (tlnm and tt_crd) for the
commands, somewhat inconsistently.  Now the linemode variable is eliminated
and the tlnm and tt_crd variables are set and reset appropriately by both
the LNM sequences and the Kermit commands, and used appropriately during
sending and receiving.  ckocon.c, 27 Feb 94.

Added SET KEY CLEAR to restore default key mappings.  ckuus3.c, 27 Feb 94.

Implemented DECTCEM, cursor enable/disable, in OS/2 C-K VT emulator.  Added
cursor-enable and newcursor() calls to doreset().  ckocon.c, 27 Feb 94.

Implemented DECPFF, print form feed mode, in OS/2 C-K VT emulator.  Only
affects host-generated print-screen operations, not user-initiated ones.
ckocon.c, 27 Feb 94.

Added a new \Kverb, \KprintFF, to send a formfeed to the printer.
ckocon.[ch], 27 Feb 94.

Cleaned up OS/2 C-Kermit's scrollback a bit; it seems less confus(ed/ing) now.

Since we now have NO IDEA of \Kverb assignments, I removed references to
Alt keys from the Status Line, and replaced them by escape-character notation
(e.g. "Return: ^]C  Help: ^]?").  I also removed the "Alt-Help" screen,
because it's useless now that all Alt functions can be moved, combined with
other functions, etc, plus the fact that there is no good way to translate
a scan code into a key name (even if the bits are consistent, we still have
national keyboards to contend with).  Finally, I made the \Khelp verb
invoke the regular Escape-Character help screen.  ckocon.c, 27 Feb 94.

Added SHOW KVERBS command to list the available \Kverbs; operative only in
OS/2.  Wrote a nice routine to display them, that arranges them on the screen
in columns dynamically according to the screen dimensions and the width of the
widest keyword (this can be adapted later to other SHOW commands, and maybe
also to "?" menus).  ckuus5.c, 27 Feb 94.

Made new kwdhelp() routine, show \Kverbs and \Functions() with it.

It was bothering me that if you SET EXIT WARNING ON in OS/2 C-Kermit, that
it thought a TCP/IP connection was still open after it had been closed by
the other side (e.g. when you log out).  It also annoyed me that if you try
to CONNECT again, it pops you right back to command mode.  Both of these
problems were because the TCPIPLIB code in ckcnet.c was not closing the
connection from its own side and setting ttyfd to -1 when it got an i/o error.
Now fixed.  28 Feb 94.

Fixed the problems with OS/2 C-Kermit screen rollback.  ckocon.c 5A(122),
28 Feb 94.

Anna Tomecka <anna@vax.clarku.edu> noticed that SET QUIET ON didn't work
for C-Kermit's CONNECT messages any more (because of the new /QUIETLY switch).
Fixed in ckuus4.c, 2 Mar 94.

My previous interpretation of \Kprtscn was wrong.  In MS-DOS Kermit, it
toggles screen-printing on and off, so I made it that way in OS/2 C-Kermit
too.  \Kdump copies the current screen to the printer (or file).  Also, I
added a PRINTER ON indication to the status line.  ckocon.c 5A(123), 2 Mar 94.

Since it will be relatively rare for people to assign \Kverbs to keys in
combination with other characters, strings, or \Kverbs, I made a special case
for when a single \Kverb, and nothing else, is assigned to a key.  In this
case, the \Kverb is preinterpreted and its numeric index is stored in the
keymap[], indicated by setting a special bit.  When the user hits that key,
there is no need to toodle through the string looking for \Kverbs, and then
look them up to get their indices -- we just go execute the \Kverb directly
and immediately: dokverb(index), no lookups needed.  Changed the default
keymap to be preloaded with \Kverb indices rather than strings; got rid of
macrotabinit() routine, moved all key initializations to keymapinit(), moved
keymapinit() to ckocon.c, where it belongs.  Changed SHOW KEY to account for
the \Kverb indices.  ckuus3.c, ckotio.c, ckocon.c, 2 Mar 94.

This change lets us easily find out which functions are assigned to which
keys, which once again lets us give accurate help -- at least for US
keyboards.  Added an array of key names, indexed by scan code.  Added a lookup
through the keymap for the \Kexit and \Khelp codes, and if found to display
the corresponding key name.  2 Mar 94.

Created a structure of Very Important Keys (VIKs), whose names are needed
in the status line or popup help screens, which is filled in each
time the CONNECT command is entered, eliminating all key lookups during the
CONNECT session.  ckocon.c, 3 Mar 94.

Used the VIK structure to fill in all key references in the status line,
including the special rolled-back screen status line.  ckocon.c, 3 Mar 94.

Restored the \Khelp popup screen.  Now it lists everything that Alt-? used
to list before, but with the correct key legends in case the assignments
changed, and with functions omitted that are not assigned to any keys.
If a function is assigned to more than one key, only the first (lowest scan
code) key is listed.  ckocon.c, 3 Mar 94.

Added SET TERMINAL ROLL { ON, OFF } as in MS-DOS Kermit.  This controls what
happens when screens are rolled back.  OFF (the default) means a rolled-back
screen is treated just like a normal screen: you can communicate with the host
without affecting the rollback status -- this allows you to send characters
while viewing a rolled-back screen, and allows arriving characters to be
displayed on the "old" screen.  ON restores the earlier behavior, in which you
are constrained to typing only rollback keys while the screen is rolled back;
no characters are sent to the host, and newly arrived characters are displayed
only after rolling forward to the bottom of the rollback buffer, i.e. to the
current screen.  ckuusr.h, ckuus[357].c, ckocon.c, 3 Mar 94.

The \KprtScn was acting just like host-directed transparent print, i.e.
sending all received characters to the printer *instead* of to the screen.
This was a little surprising, so I added a flag to distinguish between host-
directed printing and user-directed printing.  ckocon.c, 3 Mar 94.

It seems there was a large installation that was using C-Kermit 5A(165) or
thereabouts, which had deployed thousands of MS-DOS Kermit scripts that looked
for strings in the old server message, which changed in 5A(183), August 1992.
They could not upgrade to the current release without visiting numerous sites
and installing new script programs.  So I added an OLDMSG compilation option.
ckcmai.c, 3 Mar 94.

In OS/2 C-Kermit, HANGUP did not do anything on network connections.
Fixed in tthang(), ckotio.c 5A(123), 4 Mar 94.

Added to OS/2 C-K pop-up \Khelp screen: printer toggle, screen forwards, push
to OS/2, print formfeed.  Changed default mappings so that their key names are
reasonably portable among all national systems/keyboards/versions.  Help is
now Alt-Tab rather than Alt-?, Reset is now Alt-R rather than Alt-= (but Alt-=
is kept active too for compatibility), and flip screen is moved from Alt-R
to Alt-V (for Video).  ckocon.c 5A(125), 4 Mar 94.

Enabled \Kdump (print/dump screen) during rollback, again, even when
TERMINAL ROLL is ON.  ckocon.c, 4 Mar 94.

Made a new popup help screen for rolled-back screens.  Made popup help box
use its own screen buffer, so it would work with rolled-back screens too.
Made popup help save and restore status line; previously the rollback status
line was wiped out after a help box.  ckocon.c, 4 Mar 94.

Cleaned up the cursor on/off routines in OS/2 C-Kermit a bit -- it turned out
you couldn't call the cursor-on routine if the cursor was already on, you'd
lose the cursor, or turn it into some weird blob.  Made these routines protect
themselves against this.  So now it's harder to make the cursor disappear.
Also, made "reset terminal" turn the cursor back on if it was off.
ckocon.c, 4 Mar 94.

Fixed bug in parsing SET TERMINAL DEBUG and ROLL in which the command-editing
keys didn't work right.  ckuus7.c, 4 Mar 94.

Added two new variables: \v(rows), \v(cols) -- console screen rows and columns.
ckuus4.c, 4 Mar 94.

Fixed SHOW VARIABLES -- it had stopped pausing after a screenful.
ckuus5.c, 4 Mar 94.

Added support for CK_REDIR (REDIRECT command) for NeXTSTEP, from Dave Johnson
<ddj@gradient.com>.  ckcdeb.h, ckutio.c 5A(126), 6 Mar 94.

phaniraj@badlands.NoDak.edu (V. Phaniraj) noticed that SET TERMINAL
{ ARROW-KEYS, KEYPAD } { ON, OFF } was working backwards.  Fixed in ckuus7.c,
6 Mar 94.

Fixed an error in ckuus5.c in which tt_rows and cmd_rows, etc, were
referenced but not declared if CK_NAWS was not defined, reported by many.
6 Mar 94.

Backed off on enabling REDIRECT for NeXT -- it broke a lot of NeXT
compilations.  ckcdeb.h, ckutio.c, 6 Mar 94.

Changed OS/2 default key map again.  Alt-Tab was a bad choice -- in a windowed
session, it moves the window to the background.  So now Alt-h is Help, Alt-u
is Hangup.  ckocon.c 5A(126), 7 Mar 94.

Made VT220 the default emulation for OS/2, since it is, after all, a superset
of VT102 and VT100.  ckocon.c 5A(126), 7 Mar 94.

Changed OS/2 emulator's response to color-setting escape sequences, CSI 3x;4xm,
to reverse the fore/background sense if the screen is in reverse video mode
(DECSNM).  ckocon.c 5A(126), 7 Mar 94.

Corrected REDIRECT code for NeXT -- I had messed up Dave Johnson's changes the
first time.  ckutio.c, 7 Mar 94.

Marko Teittinen (marko@cs.umd.edu) noticed that SET KEY \blah \27b was
erroneously misinterpreted as \Kbreak.  Fixed in ckuus3.c and ckucmd.c by
adding a new xlookup() function, requires exact match, and by fixing a couple
out-of-order entries in the keyboard verb table in ckocon.h.  7 Mar 94.

Marko also reported the following: "I have noticed that when the normal mode
background is low intensity color (for example lgray), underline attribute
background doesn't display high intensity.  My preferred color settings are
(these worked for 189):

  set term color normal black lgray
  set term color under black white
  set term color status white blue

(end quote)".  I said this was because the background intensity was reserved
to indicate blinking.  Marko persisted: "I would still argue that both high
and low intensity backgrounds should be allowed.  There could be a warning in
the doc files, that blinking may pass unnoticed on the screen, if mixed
backgrounds are used, but please don't make me lose my favorite feature in
C-Kermit.  I've never seen blinking color attributes except in some animated
text files, but I'm willing to lose those for good underline highlighting.  I
want to have black text color, and all low intensity backgrounds (except light
gray) are terrible.  Then again the bright white background is too bright to
use for the whole window (=hurts my eyes).  Using high intensity backgrounds
I'm able to get highlight marker effect for the special attributes."  This
seems quite reasonable, so I made the suggested change.  ckocon.c, 7 Mar 94.

Added \Kignore for Num Lock to the default key map, to prevent the Num Lock
key from beeping.  ckocon.c, 7 Mar 94.

Added new verbs \Ktn_ip (send TELNET Interrupt Process) and \Ktn_ayt (send
TELNET Are You There).  By default, they are not assigned to any keys.
ckocon.[ch], 7 Mar 94.

Ric Anderson noticed that OS/2 C-Kermit would crash if you Ctrl-C'd the file
transfer display screen.  Sure enough, an alarm was left active that should
have been turned off.  This happened not only in the OS/2 version, but also
the VMS version.  Fixed in trap(), ckuusx.c.  8 Mar 94.

Ric Anderson also noticed that 0x80 (NUL with 8th bit on), received by
OS/2 C-Kermit's terminal emulator, was treated as CSI (ESC [).  In fact, it
turns out that *any* C1 control was treated as CSI because two statements
were transposed.  This is now fixed too.  ckocon.c 5A(127) 8 Mar 94.

Jim Reisert <reisert@wrksys.enet.dec.com> noticed a case where clear-to-end-
of-line was "leaking attributes" (while running DEC Notes on VMS).  Several
of the clearing functions were indeed filling the cleared area with the
current video attribute rather than the default attribute.  Fixed in ckocon.c
5A(128), 9 Mar 94.

Changed OS/2 C-Kermit's session debugging facility to show 8-bit C1 characters
literally, rather than as ESC blah, to aid in debugging of 8-bit VMS sessions.
ckocon.c, 9 Mar 94.

Fixed the bug in which the TELNET lead-in character (255) would sometimes be
shown on the terminal emulation screen (often as y-diaeresis).  And conversely,
the one in which a quoted IAC (255) would *not* be shown on the terminal
screen.  ckocon.c, ckucon.c 5A(060), ckvcon.c 5A(033), ckdcon.c 5A(045),
cklcon.c 5A(002), 9 Mar 94.

I seem to have fixed the problem of the cursor being in the wrong place after
escaping back to the OS/2 command screen.  I'm not sure how I did it, but I
can't make it happen any more.  ckocon.c, 9 Mar 94.

Fixed a subtle bug in the command parser, in which a temporary program
prompt would be forgotten if the user typed ? to get help, if the
prompt-setting call did not include a pointer to an evaluation function.
ckucmd.c 5A(057), 9 Mar 94.

Enabled \Kxxxx, where xxxx is a macro name.  ckuus3.c, ckuusr.c 5A(125),
ckocon.c, 9 Mar 94.  Example:

  define download receive, connect
  set key \417 \Kdownload

This puts the act of receiving a file from a remote Kermit that has already
been told to send it on a "hot key", in this case Alt-Page-Down on the PC.
C-Kermit will not automatically reenter terminal emulation upon completion of
the macro unless the macro includes a CONNECT command, as in the example
above.

Enabled SET KEY commands to be given on separate lines, as in MS-DOS Kermit.
SET KEY <return> now prompts you press a key or key combo, so you don't have
to know the scan code.  Then it shows you the current definition and prompts
you for a new one.  ckuus3.c, 9 Mar 94.

In OS/2 C-Kermit, added a 5-second write timeout to reduce the amount of
popping back to command mode that happens when the user types something but
CTS is not being asserted by the DCE.  Doesn't seem to make a lot of
difference.  ckotio.c, 9 Mar 94. 

Changed CKERMIT.CMD to use arg(1) rather than %1 %2 ... %9 to pass arguments
to OS/2 C-Kermit, suggested by Drew Derbyshire <kermit@kew.com>.  10 Mar 94.

Replaced the white-background OS/2 C-Kermit icon with a transparent-background
one, from Hugo Jimenez <jimenez@gaus90.chem.yale.edu>.  10 Mar 94.

Installed a patch from Mike Freeman <mikef@pacifier.rain.com> to enable
Ctrl-A status reports even when FILE DISPLAY is NONE.  ckuusx.c, 10 Mar 94.

Fixed the bug with the cursor being restored to the wrong position (sometimes)
when escaping back to the OS/2 C-Kermit prompt from CONNECT mode.  The problem
was introduced when I implemented the VT220 DECTCEM (cursor enable/disable)
feature (27 Feb 94), I used the cursoron flag to indicate whether the cursor
was enabled or disabled (makes sense, right?).  When the CONNECT command
exits, it calls restorescreen(&commandscreen), which restores the saved
command screen.  restorescreen() then calls lgotoxy() to put the cursor in the
saved place.  But lgotoxy() doesn't do anything unless cursoron != 0.  Well,
cursoron would be zero if characters were arriving at the time we escaped back
(because we gain screen-painting speed by turning off the cursor whenever more
than 20 characters are waiting to be read).  It can also be off if the screen
is rolled back, etc.  The obvious solution would have been to simply set
cursoron to 1 before restoring the command screen, but that would break the
DECTCEM feature.  So now we save the cursoron value, set cursoron to 1, call
restorescreen(), and then restore the cursoron value before returning from
CONNECT mode.  ckocon.c 5A(129), 10 Mar 94.

OS/2 C-Kermit's DEC keypad verbs were badly fractured.  SET TERMINAL KEYPAD
NUMERIC and APPLICATION were backwards, but the corresponding escape sequences
were not.  Furthermore, much of the \Kverb-interpreting code was backwards too
(thus compensating for the first mistake...).  Thanks to Jim Reisert for
persistent reports about this.  Fixed in ckocon.c 5A(129), 10 Mar 94.

Added default assignments for DEC keypad minus, period, comma, and Enter, to
the corresponding main keypad Alt combinations.  Also made default assignments
for screen scroll and arrow keys to the appropriate numeric keypad keys when
Num Lock is Off.  ckocon.c, ckcker.upd, 10 Mar 94.

Fixed SHOW KEY command not to say "Undefined" when a key is defined.
ckuus5.c, 10 Mar 94.

Added support for VT220 S7C1T and S8C1T escape sequences for selecting 7
and 8-bit transmission of DEC keys (ESC [ vs CSI, etc).  ckocon.c, 10 Mar 94.

Added an ANSI terminal type to OS/2 C-Kermit.  This involved adding support
for some escape sequences used by ANSI.SYS that are not in the VT100++
repertoire, plus forcing white on black coloration, character-set
transparency, and no chopping of 8th bits, and restoring all of that if the
user sets the terminal type to something else after using ANSI.  ckuusr.h,
ckuusr.c 5A(126), ckuus7.c, ckocon.c 5A(130), 11 Mar 94.

Added SET TERMINAL TYPE NONE to OS/2 C-Kermit.  The idea was to let the
console driver handle the screen.  Theoretically, this would allow
substitution of different emulations by installing different console drivers,
and might also allow "pass-through" types of connections (dial up OS/2, run
C-Kermit, dial out from C-Kermit to someplace else).  ckuus7.c, ckocon.c, 11
Mar 94.  But it didn't work, at least not as intended -- the console driver
seems to have its ANSI features disabled.  Control characters are handled
OK, but escape sequences are simply printed.  (Turns out this could be fixed
by using different "write" calls, but it's not worth it.)

Joel Seiferas <joel@cs.rochester.edu> reported that reading news on UNIX
produced "striped" screens when OS/2 C-Kermit's screen was in reverse video
mode (\Kflipscrn).  Sure enough.  Fixed in ckocon.c 5A(130), 11 Mar 94.

Removed SET TERMINAL TYPE NONE from OS/2 C-Kermit.  It doesn't do anything, so
there's no point.  ckuus3.c, 12 Mar 94.

Changed all sets and tests of tt_keypad and tt_arrow to reference symbolic
values for clarity: TTK_NORM means normal (numeric or cursor) mode; TTK_APPL
means application mode.  These have tricked me too many times, no more!
ckuusr.h, ckocon.c, ckuus3.c, 12 Mar 94.

Fixed "more"-prompting in SHOW VARIABLES to account for the length of the
\v(input) string, and also improved the display to show control chars
symbolically.  ckuus5.c, 12 Mar 94.

Added dummy code to set the code page from Kai Uwe -- it doesn't do anything,
since when he tried to use it, it crashed; also, the call to set the code
page is no longer documented in OS/2 2.x.  ckotio.c, 12 Mar 94.

Added code to OS/2 C-K from Kai Uwe Rommel to make RTS/CTS work during CONNECT
mode.  When transmission is blocked due to lack of CTS, an asterisk appears in
the status line on the name of the COM port, e.g. "*COM1".
ckocon.c, 12 Mar 94.

Added SET TERMINAL CTS-TIMEOUT to let user specify the longest CTS blockage
to tolerate during CONNECT mode.  ckuusr.h, ckuus7.c, ckuus2.c, 12 Mar 94.

Fixed SHOW TERMINAL to include CURSOR and CTS-TIMEOUT.  This involved some
rearranging of the screen, since it was already full.  You still can't find
out what the terminal colors are set to -- not only do we lack the screen
real estate, but we don't really know -- they are not simple variables that
"stay put" when we set them -- they also have attribute bits that change,
they get reversed, etc etc.  ckuus5.c, 12 Mar 94.

Compose-key support for OS/2 C-Kermit.  Keyboard verb \Kcompose enabled, can
be assigned to any key.  Compose sequences are roughly those used by DEC VT220
and higher for Latin-1.  No support for Latin-2, Cyrillic, Hebrew, etc.  Made
a special status line while a compose sequence is going on, and made a special
popup help screen too.  ckocon.[ch], 12 Mar 94.

Minor cosmetic improvements to the Alt-H popup help screen.
ckocon.c, 12 Mar 94.

Changed OS/2 C-Kermit's CONNECT-mode character-sending function to beep and
discard characters entered while in its transmission-failure retry loop.
This prevents typeahead from being passed along to the command prompt when the
retry timer expires and CONNECT mode is broken, with possibly disastrous
results; suggested by Ric Anderson.  ckocon.c 5A(132), 13 Mar 94.

When transmission is blocked, instead of putting a cryptic "*" in the status
line, now we write a new status line saying "TRANSMISSION BLOCKED: x", where
x is the countdown timer.  Fun to watch, and informative too!
ckocon.c 5A(132), 13 Mar 94.

Changed SET TERMINAL CTS-TIMEOUT to SET TERMINAL TRANSMIT-TIMEOUT -- easier
for most people to understand, and it might also apply to other situations.
ckuus[257].c, 13 Mar 94.

There were major problems with the OS/2 C-Kermit CONNECT-mode status line.
With all the recent additions to the program, the status line was being used
for lots of things in addition to its normal purpose (to show emulation, how
to get help, how to escape back, the comm device, etc): rollback status,
Compose-key minibuffer, how to make a popup help screen go away, debug mode,
printer active, transmission blocked, etc etc.  Some of these conditions could
occur while others were active: for example, after rolling back some screens,
you might start a compose sequence, and then request popup help -- at this
point, the status line is pushed three levels deep.  But till now, there was
no stack to push the status lines onto.  Now we have a stack that will hold up
to ten levels of status lines, including their separate parts (usertext,
helptext, exittext, etc), so that massive amounts of recoding were not
necessary to get this working fairly well.  ckocon.c 5A(132), 13 Mar 94.

Fixed a bug in OS/2 C-Kermit VT emulation: ESC [ 2 J clears the whole
screen but does NOT move the cursor.  In ANSI emulation, however, ESC [ 2 J
also homes the cursor (ref: DOS 5.0 manual, ANSI.SYS description; DEC VT 220
Programmers Manual).  ckocon.c 5A(133), 14 Mar 94.

Added a WINNT symbol for Windows-NT-specific features, in preparation for a
Windows NT version, which, presumably, will follow the OS/2 32-bit path.
ckcdeb.h, ckuver.h, 24 Mar 94.

A few minor corrections to the makefile for Solaris 2.3 builds with gcc and
SunPro cc, plus some minor tweaks to ckuus3.c, ckuus6.c, ckcfn2.c, in which
variables named partab conflicted with Solaris library functions.  Added two
new makefile options for Solaris 2.x, which should be the preferred, normal
ones from now on: solaris2x (for use with SunPro C) and solaris2xg (for GCC).
25 Mar 94.

Changed the way the UNIX man page is produced.  Instead of one man-page fits
all, the man page is now generated automatically as part of the C-Kermit build
procedure, based on the CFLAGS used at compile time.  The "source code" for
the man page is now called ckuker.cpp.  It is run through the C preprocessor
with the same CFLAGS as used for compiling C-Kermit.  It contains #ifdef's
just like C-Kermit source code.  An output file, ckuker.nr, is produced that
is suitable for use as input to "nroff -man", i.e. as a UNIX man page.
Requires cc -E and grep.  The man page itself contains very little in the way
of #ifdefs (for now, only a small amount of special wording for HP-UX 10.0 and
SunOS/Solaris), but the way is now clear to add them liberally -- for example,
to remove references to TCP/IP if TCPSOCKET is not defined, etc.
ckuker.cpp, makefile, 25 Mar 94.

Backed off on automatic man page generation.  Turns out the cc -E method is
not portable.  The first system I tried it on outside of SunOS 4.1.x choked
on it.  Man pages are now generated by hand.  To produce the default general-
purpose man page:

  make manpage

To make a custom man page:

  make CFLAGS=-DHPUX100 manpage

26 Mar 94.

Installed an HPFS partition and a "real printer" on my OS/2 system so I can
exercise more of OS/2 C-K's features.

From Kai Uwe Rommel, new OS/2 C-Kermit scan codes for Tab (to distinguish
from Ctrl-I) and Shift-Esc.  ckocon.c 5A(134), ckotio.c 5A(124), 26 Mar 94.

From Kai Uwe Rommel, OS/2 C-Kermit code to get and set the title bar text,
not used, saved for future reference under #ifdef CK_SETTITLE.  ckotio.c,
26 Mar 94.  Kai Uwe's comments:

  There is an undocumented system call for this purpose. I have added
  two functions to ckotio.c for this purpose, as well as code to
  save/restore the original session title. I have not yet added code
  where to call it since we should first think a bit over where it may
  make sense to change the title. 

  Unfortunately, as I said, the call is undocumented, although it is
  used by CMD.EXE itself to control the title bar of sessions. I would
  therefore like it if that code were not in the distributed executables
  but only available for those who want to recompile themselves. I have
  added a symbol CK_SETTITLE for this purpose. The call does also
  require a defintion for the system loader where to find it. That can
  be provided by

	  IMPLIB SESMGR.LIB C:\OS2\DLL\SESMGR.DLL

  And linking C-Kermit with that library.

  The opposite call, to determine the current title, is documented but
  only for PM applications. It happens to work for text mode programs
  too, but that is to be considered "undocumented" too.  Only PM
  applications have real control over their title bar. What is better
  documented possible is to change the value of the entry of a session
  in the task list (window list).

Added \v(terminal) to get the terminal type.  In OS/2, it's the current
SET TERMINAL TYPE, in others, it's getenv("TERM").  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c,
ckuusr.c 5A(127), 26 Mar 94.

Changed OS/2 C-Kermit's escape-character argument for hanging up to be U
rather than H.  Now it's more like the default "hot keys": H for help, U
for hangup.  Previously, it was too easy to hang up by accident this way.
ckocon.c, 26 Mar 94.

Added SET TERMINAL COLOR BORDER <color> to OS/2 C-Kermit, based on info
from Kai Uwe Rommel -- this sets the color of the border around the terminal
emulation screen in OS/2 fullscreen sessions only.  Added this to CKERMOD.INI;
a green border seems nice; changed the status line to white on gray.
ckuusr.h, ckuus7.c, ckocon.c, 26 Mar 94.

Changed OS/2 C-Kermit's SET TERMINAL TYPE ANSI command to automatically set
the code page to 437, saving the old one, and to restore the old code page
upon SET TERM TYPE <anything-else>, based on info profided by Kai Uwe.  Also
added a SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE command, but left it commented out because it
needs to verify that the given code-page number is valid, and then succeed or
fail immediately -- it seemed to me like switching code pages was a bad way
to do this...  ckuus7.c, 26 Mar 94.

Several people reported that the previous edit of OS/2 C-Kermit would hang
uninterruptibly when sent the ESC Z or CSI 0 c (What are you?) query in VT220
mode on a serial (not network) connection.  It seems that sendstr() was
overrunning the output device by calling ttoci() too rapidly; this happened
whenever the string to be sent was longer than 4 or 5 characters, and probably
also when the UART did not have an output silo (mine doesn't, so I could
reproduce this problem easily).  I added an msleep(50) between each character
as a bandaid.  This should only affect the sending of escape sequences (mostly
query responses, since VT key sequences are never more than 3-4 chars long).
ckocon.c, 26 Mar 94.

Changed OS/2 C-Kermit INSTALL script to ask the user about the VT220 key
mappings and to put a TAKE command in CKERMOD.INI for them if she wants them.
ckoins.cmd / install.scr, 26 Mar 94.

Michael Godfrey noticed that in OS/2 C-Kermit, during DEBUG terminal-emulation
display, if you escape back while control characters are being shown in
underline coloration, and then SET TERM DEBUG OFF, and then CONNECT again,
that the colors don't go back to normal.  There were also some coloring mixups
when making TELNET connections; TELNET negotiations would be printed in
seemingly random colors.  Fixed in ckuus7.c and ckocon.c, 26 Mar 94.

Also noticed that session debugging could write stuff to the terminal screen
even when we weren't in CONNECT mode, oops!  Fixed in ckocon.c, 26 Mar 94.
But this fix means we lose the first couple negotations from the terminal
screen, since they happen at ttopen() time, before the CONNECT module is
entered.  No big deal, they can still be captured in the debug.log.

Changed SET TERMINAL DEBUG to show TELNET options in boldface.
ckocon.c, ckcnet.c, 26 Mar 94.

Fixed WRITE TRANSACTION-LOG command; previously, it would accept no
abbreviations.  Noticed by Max Evarts.  ckuusr.c, 26 Mar 94.

Found a bunch of SET commands that were returning SUCCESS when there
were parsing errors.  Fixed in ckuus7.c, 26 Mar 94.  There are probably
more of these in other modules...

There were complaints that VMS C-Kermit sometimes failed to SET SPEED.
Evidently, the actual speed setting worked OK, but then the SET SPEED command
went back to read the speed and compare with what it thought it had set, and
they did not compare.  Turns out the VMS ttgspd() routine didn't really do
anything except return the speed variable -- which was not SET yet!  A slight
amount of creative recoding fixes the problem.  CKVTIO.C 2.0-072, 27 Mar 94.
(But it would, of course, be better to have the VMS ttgspd() actually make a
system call to read the device speed...)

Added support for file-append operations -- OPEN APPEND, LOG .. APPEND,
SET FILE COLLISION APPEND, etc, in VMS C-Kermit, code from Terry Kennedy.
CKVFIO.C 2.0-108, 27 Mar 94.

Added SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE to OS/2 C-Kermit, thanks to a new support
routine, os2checkcp(), from Kai Uwe Rommel, ckuus7.c, 17 Mar 94.

Cleaned up SHOW TERMINAL DISPLAY, added CODE-PAGE to it, added LOG SESSION
to it, etc, ckuus5.c, 17 Mar 94.

In OS/2 C-Kermit, it was still possible for the cursor to disappear if you
executed the \Kpush verb (os2push() routine) during CONNECT mode and then ran
an application (such as SYSLEVEL) that turned off your cursor -- noticed by
Ric Anderson.  os2push() now explicitly turns the cursor on when resuming
CONNECT mode unless the cursor was previously disabled.  Also changed
os2push() to restore the CONNECT-mode border color upon return to CONNECT
mode.  ckocon.c 5A(135), 27 Mar 94.

The VMS C-Kermit DELETE, DIRECTORY, and RENAME commands would change the
terminal mode, but forgot to change it back, so command editing didn't work
any more after giving these commands.  Fixed in ckuus6.c, 27 Mar 94.

Added some more helpful info to the OS/2 C-K rollback popup help screen.
ckocon.c, 27 Mar 94.

Removed "^L to refresh screen" from OS/2 C-K's fullscreen file transfer
display.  ckuusx.c, 27 Mar 94.

Added support for 57600 and 115200 bps for NetBSD, from Mike Long
<Mike.Long@analog.com>, plus various other NetBSD fixups.  ckcdeb.h, ckcfn3.c
(sys_errlist[] declaration), ckutio.c 5A(127) (UUCP lockfile directory).
Also, SHOW PROTOCOL display was malformatted if C-Kermit built with NOSERVER.
ckuus4.c.  27 Mar 94.

John Chandler reported that when C-K is doing a non-windowed transfer
(i.e. window size < 2), and an ACK arrives (again) for the previous packet,
C-Kermit just sits there & does nothing.  In the non-windowed case, it should
treat this as a NAK for the current packet, so it can retransmit the current
packet right away, rather than waiting for its timer to go off.  ckcfn2.c,
ckcfns.c 5A(104), 27 Mar 94.

In the process of testing the previous item, discovered that OS/2 C-Kermit
lowercased any strings that were given to SET KEY.  Fixed in xlookup(),
ckucmd.c 5A(058), 27 Mar 94.

Added SET SEND / RECEIVE PAUSE <msec> command, hopefully to help when engaging
in Kermit protocol with a real slow or buggy machine, like the HP48, which
goes deaf for a short time after sending a packet.  ckuus7.c, 27 Mar 94.

Bo Kullmar got Kermit to crash while dialing, a traceback indicated it was
in a free() -- so changed every "free(blah);" to "if (blah) free(blah);
blah = NULL;".  ckudia.c 5A(058), 27 Mar 94.

Added some simple code, suggested by Terry Kennedy, to cut down on the
zombie processes left behind when the VMS C-Kermit server gets a BYE.
ckvtio.c, 27 Mar 94.

28 Mar 94: Started getting 5A(190) ready for public testing.  Changed
designation from "Development" to "ALPHA.01".  Fixed a minor glitch with the
status line during screen rollback in OS/2.  Changed the CHECK command to name
the missing feature if it gives an error message.  Compiled, linked, and ran
on many systems and in many configurations, fixing compiler & makefile
glitches along the way: SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.3, NeXTSTEP 3.1, Linux 0.99.14,
Dell SVR4, HP-UX 8.0, 4.4BSD, OSF/1, DG/UX 5.4, AIX 3.2, ULTRIX 4.2, ...

Discovered a typo in ckuxla.h that caused Macintosh Latin and DG Multinational
character sets to get the same designator.  Macintosh Latin translations were
broken since HP-Roman8 was added in December '93; nobody noticed until me,
using OS/2 C-Kermit to look at the Mac Kermit makefile...  29 Mar 94.

Got C-Kermit to compile on Solaris 2.3 with SunPro CC.  29 Mar 94.

Data General AOS/VS version compiles and links without complaint, but won't
run: "Memory allocation error on program initialization: insufficient pages
available for stack/heap space".  But 189 runs OK on the same system.  Sent
a message to DG asking about this.  29 Mar 94.

Spent a long time trying to compile the Macintosh version with MPW C 3.2.  Ran
into problems with wart (ckwart.c) -- Finally I realized that the fakeouts for
fopen and friends that were done in ckcdeb.h did not (and must not) apply to
ckwart.c, because ckwart.c is not linked with the module (ckmfio) where the
fakeout routines (mac_fopen, etc) are defined.  Then there were compilation
problems with ckmtio.c & some others, fixed.  29 Mar 94.

So the Mac version compiled and linked OK, but crashed when I tried to run it.
Luckily I had Macsbug loaded and was able to get a stack dump -- it crashed in
cmdini() in ckuus5.c.  It seems Mac Kermit was trying to open an init file --
apparently somebody added part of the code for this, but not all of it, so
mac_fopen() was being passed an uninitialized string pointer for the file
name.  I #ifndef MAC'd all of the init-file code, and now it works OK.
ckuus5.c, 29 Mar 94.

Eugenia Harris of DG changed the LINK command for AOS/VS C-Kermit to make
it allocate a bigger heap+stack, now it runs OK.  30 Mar 94.

In fact, now it compiles, links, and runs OK on all platforms where I am able
to test it, so we're just about ready for public Alpha testing.

OS/2 C-Kermit would no longer recognize the Tab key for purposes of command
completion.  Fixed in ckotio.c, 30 Mar 94.

Added display of valid code pages to OS/2 C-Kermit SHOW TERM, and simplified
SET TERM CODE-PAGE, code from Kai Uwe Rommel, 30 Mar 94.

Jim Reisert reported that leaning on a function key while OS/2 C-Kermit was in
CONNECT mode on a serial connection resulted in "TRANSMISSION BLOCKED" errors.
I noticed that there were two routines in ckocon.c that did essentially the
same thing: sendstr() and sendescseq().  I had already modified one of them to
insert a 50-msec pause between each character; this time I just merged the
two routines.  The result tests just fine at both 19200 bps and 300 bps.
ckocon.c 5A(136), 30 Mar 94.

Made new makefile entries for, and built C-Kermit on, UnixWare 1.1.
"make unixware" (no TCP/IP, no curses), and "make unixwarenetc" (Lachman
TCP/IP, curses).

Fixed another OS/2 C-Kermit terminal bug, reported by Ric Anderson: if
SET TERMINAL ROLL ON, and the End key is pushed before any other rollback
keys, we get the Black Screen Of Death.  Fixed in ckocon.c 5A(137), 31 Mar 94.

Same deal as yesterday, but this time when sending strings assigned to keys.
ckocon.c, 31 Mar 94.

Thanks to a report from wilkins@rockvax.rockefeller.edu, I learned that the
APC command was ineffective if it was given as the last line in a command
file (in this case, the last line of the .kermrc file) in the Solaris version.
Turns out the Solaris version did not include -DNOSETBUF, and so the APC
sequence was not being followed by an fflush(), on the assumption that output
was unbuffered anyway.  I added -DNOSETBUF to the Solaris version, and I also
made the apres-APC fflush() unconditional.  ckuus5.c, 31 Mar 94.

Jeffrey Altman noticed that the OUTPUT command was generating garbage
under OS/2.  Another apparent case of IBM C generating bad code.  I rewrote
the code to use no macros and simpler types of expressions, seems to work
ok now, but somewhat slower.  ckuus5.c, 1 Apr 94.

Jamie Watson <jw@adasoft.ch>, working with IBM engineers, changed the
AIX/RS-6000 flow control code to comply with IBM's recommendations.
ckutio.c 5A(129), 4 Apr 94.  Jamie tested this on:

  RS/6000-520, AIX 3.2.5 (rs6aix32c)
  RS/6000-520, AIX 3.2.3 (rs6aix32c)
  RS/6000-320, AIX 3.1.5 (rs6000c)
  RT/PC 6150-125, AIX 2.2.1 (rtaixc)

as well as several ULTRIX systems.

New OS/2 INSTALL.CMD from Jeffrey Altman, keeps old CKOVTK2.INI file intact
if it already existed, since the user might have customized it, and to avoid
asking the user CKERMOD.INI-related questions if the user already has a
CKERMOD.INI in the destination directory.  4 Apr 94.

Added \v(connection) to show the connection when in local mode:  "serial",
"tcp/ip telnet", "decnet lat", etc.  This allows a script program to take
different actions depending on the connection type.  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c,
4 Apr 94.

Bill Schlesinger of the Motorola System Support Center pointed out that the
DIR and REMOTE DIR commands did not (necessarily) work under a restricted
shell in UNIX, because DIRCMD and DIRCMD2 were defined to include the
full path, instead of just the command name, and so did not follow the PATH
environment variable.  Removed the path from these strings, made them just
"ls -l".  ckufio.c 5A(084) 4 Apr 94.

Added SET TERMINAL HIDE-CURSOR { ON, OFF } to OS/2 version, to allow user to
turn off the cursor-hiding feature; this reduces confusion at the expense of
slower screen updating.  On a 486/66, with TERMINAL HIDE ON (the default), on
a TELNET connection (where the CPU is the limiting factor), fullscreen, it
takes 20 seconds to dump a 1000-line, 80-column file to the screen; with HIDE
OFF, it takes 33 seconds.  The difference is negligible on a serial
connection, where the communication speed is the bottleneck.  The same file
takes about 46 seconds to display on a 19200 bps connection with SET TERMINAL
HIDE OFF or ON.  ckuusr.h, ckuus2.c (HELP), ckuus5.c (SHOW), ckuus7.c (SET),
ckocon.c 5A(138), 5 Apr 94.

In OS/2 C-Kermit, reinstalled Kai Uwe's code to get and set the session name
in the task list, and added a call to the SET LINE / SET HOST code in
ckuus7.c to actually set the name to the current communication device or
host name.  ckuus7.c, ckotio.c 5A(128), 5 Apr 94.

Looked into adding APC support to the UNIX version, but there were too many
obstacles, the worst being that the APC command would be collected in the
lower CONNECT fork, which has no good way to pass it back upstairs when it
exits.  So forget it.  5 Apr 94.

Added code to VMS version from Terry Kennedy to fill in the LENGTH-IN-K
file attribute, which heretofore had always been specified as 0.
CKVFIO.C 2.0-109, 5 Apr 94.

Looked into making the TAKE command in OS/2 not require a full filespec if
the file is in INIT, DPATH, or PATH.  This one turned out to be impractical
too -- it would require a custom copy of cmifi(), which is a very long
procedure.  5 Apr 94.

System-wide init file for UNIX et al...  Better to let the user's personal
init file, if any, take precedence.  The system-wide copy is used only if
the user doesn't have one.  This way we don't have thousands of users
wondering why their init files don't work any more.  Also, I discovered some
code that I thought had been removed years ago: if the specified or default
init file could not be found, then Kermit looked in the current directory for
one -- bad idea!  ckuus5.c, 5 Apr 94.

More of this...  Actually, there is no single right way to handle the
system-wide init file.  There are reasons why it should take precedence over
the user's, and equally valid reasons why it shouldn't.  So I added two new
symbols: CK_INI_A means the system-wide init file should take precedence,
CK_INI_B means the user's init file should take precedence.  If neither one is
defined, CK_INI_A is assumed.  These symbols have effect only if CK_SYSINI is
also defined.  Also, in the former case, if the system-wide init file can't be
opened, C-Kermit takes the user's instead.  Details in ckuins.doc.
ckuusr.h, ckuus5.c, 5 Apr 94.

By arrangement with HP, made a default system-wide init file for HP-UX 10.0:
/usr/share/lib/kermit/ckermit.ini.  ckuusr.h, makefile, 5 Apr 94.

New INSTALL.CMD from Jeffrey Altman for OS/2 C-Kermit, which does not replace
the program object / icon if one is already there.  6 Apr 94.

Added SET TERMINAL OUTPUT-PACING to allow users to overcome UART buffer
overrun problems when pasting into OS/2 C-Kermit terminal window.
ckocon.c 5A(139), ckuusr.h, ckuus7.c, ckuusr.c 5A(131), 7 Apr 94.

Albert Crosby <acrosby@comp.uark.edu> pointed out that if OS/2 C-Kermit is
started with a -c command-line argument, the "Prompt: Alt-x" message in the
status line is misleading.  Changed the CONNECT module to write "Exit: Alt-x"
if it knows that escaping back will exit from C-Kermit.
ckocon.c 5A(140), 8 Apr 94.

Vincent Fatica noticed that the scrolling region (or rather, the bottom of
it) was lost between sessions.  Fixed in ckocon.c, 8 Apr 94.

Added a new command PSEND <filename> <starting-position> [ <as-name> ].  It's
just like send, except no wildcards are allowed, and it begins sending from
the given position (0-based byte-offset number) in the file.  The only problem
with it is that on systems where an int (in C terms) is 16 bits, we can't
parse starting positions bigger than 32767, because cmnum() returns an int;
there's a check in the parser for this.
ckuusr.h, ckuusr.c, ckcfn3.c, ckufio.c.  9 Apr 94.

Designed and coded a recovery feature.  It works only on stream format files,
only for binary-mode transfers, and requires the failed transfer to have been
done also in binary mode and with SET FILE INCOMPLETE KEEP on the receiving
end.  The only new command is RESEND.  It has exactly the same syntax as the
SEND command.  Recovery capability is negotiated at protocol startup time, and
the starting position is negotiated automatically.  9 Apr 94.

Inclusion of this feature, and also of the PSEND command, is governed by the
compile-time symbol CK_RESEND, which is defined (in ckcdeb.h) by default for
UNIX (all versions except pdp11) and OS/2.  The feature can be turned off in
these versions by adding -DNORESEND to the compile-time CFLAGS.  C-Kermit
builds and works OK if CK_RESEND is not defined.

The underlying support for CK_RESEND is available only in ckufio.c for UNIX
and OS/2: the new zfseek(pos) routine.  This needs to be filled in for the
other versions: VMS, etc.

Made SET FILE INCOMPLETE KEEP be the default.  Otherwise, RESEND and PSEND
will be of little use.  10 Apr 94.

Fixed file transfer display "Estimated Time Left" to work right for resending.
ckuusx.c, 10 Apr 94.

Got RESEND to work for the 16-bit OS/2 version by adding an MSC 6.00
compile-time switch suggested by Kai Uwe.  10 Apr 94.

Three years ago, Seth Chaiklin <psykseth@aau.dk> worked very hard on the
MAIL and REMOTE PRINT handling by the Kermit receiver.  The idea was that if
the receiver knew it was mail (or a print job), it (a) did not have to create
a file, but instead could pipe the incoming material to the appropriate
program (Mail or lpr), and (b) mail messages could have a nice subject; that
is, the "filename" from the F packet would actually be the subject.  But there
were massive problems accomplishing this; Seth actually did get it working,
but many issues remained unresolved, such as what to do about an interrupted
transfer, etc.  After all the reorganization above, it seemed like a good time
to revisit this question.  But it's still not worth it.  The basic problem is:
the F packet comes before the A packet.  We don't know it's Mail until the A
packet comes.  But it's at F-packet time we have to handle the filename
checking and collision options.  There's just no good way around this.  Also,
the idea of piping into a Mail program, etc, is specific to UNIX and so we
would still have to keep the old temp-file code around for all the other
systems.  Plus the interruption problems would remain, which we don't have now
using the temp-file method.  Plus the MAIL and REMOTE PRINT commands are so
little used that the work and the risk are not worth it.  I still have Seth's
voluminous notes and diffs (75K of them) in case this should come up again.

In verifying edit 190 on 2.11BSD (on a PDP-11), I found that somehow the
call to gethnam() is no longer resolved by the linker, so I removed it from
ckhost() in the pdp11 case.  ckuusx.c.  I also had to shuffle the overlays
around again to make them all 15K or less; one of them had exceeded the 15K
limit by 192 bytes. I also had to add switches to deselect some of the new
features like REDIRECT, RETRY, MSEND.  Overlays all OK, but the main segment
is still too big by 2K.  Two choices: remove UUCP support, or try to build
with -DDYNAMIC (I can't remember why this was never done before).  (Several
hours later...)  Now I know: for some reason, -DDYNAMIC compilation results
in *bigger* object files, rather than smaller ones, on this system.  So
out goes UUCP lockfile support.  Still not enough.  Added -DNOFRILLS.  Still
not enough.  15 Apr 94.

Removed CK_TMPDIR from PDP-11 version.  Still not enough.  Removed automatic
parity detection.  That did it.  ckubs2.mak, 18 Apr 94.

Checked DEC OSF/1 2.0.  C-Kermit compiled under OSF/1 1.3 still runs OK.
Same code compiles and runs fine under 2.0.  23 Apr 94.

Changed OS/2 section of CKERMOD.INI to eliminate garish and bold colors for
normal screens (terminal-screen, status-line, underline, etc).  Easier on the
eyes, and prevents the all-screen-blinking effect that occurs on some systems
when switching back to the terminal screen when it had a bright (white)
background.  23 Apr 94.

Changed OS/2 C-Kermit SET TERM TYPE ANSI to use light gray rather than white
as the foreground color, by popular demand.  ckuus7.c, 23 Apr 94.

Changed OS/2 C-Kermit terminal reset routine to restore the border.
ckocon.c 5A(141), 23 Apr 94.

Steven Asher <sasher@intel9.intel.com> and Russ Herman <rwh@gov.on.ca> noticed
that several keyboard verbs in OS/2 C-Kermit were wrong: \KdecInsert,
\KdecRemove, \KdecSelect, \KdecNext.  Fixed, ckocon.c, 23 Apr 94.

Ever since edit 189 was released, there have been scattered reports of
corrupted files after transfer.  Tom Kloos <tk@sequent.com> finally provided
the vital clue: it happened when certain control characters were unprefixed
*and* PARITY was not NONE (and, therefore, locking shifts were in effect).
Diagnosis: the packet decoder had never been changed to account for this
combination, and so left Ctrl-P's in the file instead of treating them as Data
Link Escapes for locking shifts.  Fix: a very small change to the decode()
routine in ckcfns.c, 5A(107), 23 Apr 94.

Changes in various places to enforce prefixing of carriage return when we know
we have a TELNET connection.  Bare carriage returns in packets are very
confusing to TELNET servers, as they should be, since they defy the TELNET
specification, which says a carriage return must always be followed by either
LF or NUL.  ckcpro.w, ckuus3.c, 23 Apr 94.

Changed UNIX, VMS, OS/2, AOS/VS C-Kermit CONNECT commands to quote not only
IAC but also DEL if it has a parity bit on a TELNET connection.  23 Apr 94.

Changed protocol module to clear counters a bit earlier to cut down on
spurious info in the file transfer display.  23 Apr 94.

Hugo Jimenez <jimenez@gaus90.chem.yale.edu> noticed that the OS/2 C-Kermit
server was sending only linefeeds, rather than CRLFs, at the end of each line
output by an inferior process, e.g. in response to REMOTE DIRECTORY.  Cure
from Kai Uwe Rommel: in zxcmd(), open the pipe with mode "rb" rather than
just "r".  ckufio.c 5A(086) 26 Apr 94.

Downloaded IBM C/C++ CSDs from IBM OS/2 BBS and applied them to the OS/2
C compiler.  27 Apr 94.

A tester complained that if OS/2 C-Kermit starts a Rexx program and the
Rexx program includes "call ckcommand connect", that Kermit terminates after
2 seconds.  This turned out to be caused by the fact that the setjmp was
being done in one thread, but the longjmp in another, which happened when the
call to congks(2) (wait 2 sec for a keystroke) timed out.  The reason for the
timeout is to allow Kermit to check every 2 seconds to see if the connection
has dropped, in which case it can pop back to the prompt automatically.
Fixing this required complete redesign and rewriting of the keyboard input
routines, which was done by Jeffrey Altman.  ckocon.c, ckotio.c, 27 Apr 94.

But it doesn't work in the 16-bit version...  Jeff then conditionalized the
new code for the 32-bit version only, keeping the old code in the 16-bit
version.  29 Apr 94.

Jeff also fixed a bug with PUSH, RUN, ! in the OS/2 version.  ckufio.c
5A(087) 29 Apr 94.

Joel Seiferas <joel@cs.rochester.edu> reported crashes when receiving files
in the OS/2 version and SET FILE COLLISION RENAME.  The debug log revealed
this had something to do with the .LONGNAME extended attribute -- somehow
a huge name was being generated and written to the static buffer, which was
too short for it.  Jeff made a workaround for this -- a dynamic buffer, an
additional debugging statement -- in ckufio.c, so we can track down the real
reason this is happening.  Installed and announced as 5A(190) ALPHA.04.
ckufio.c, ckcfns.c, 29 Apr 94.

An hour later...  Jeff found and fixed the .LONGNAME bug.  ckufio.c, ckcfns.c,
again, 29 Apr 94, 5A(190) ALPHA.05.

New OS/2 C-K keyboard reading code, again, from Jeff, to correct problems that
were discovered by testers over the weekend.  ckotio.c 5A(130), ckocon.c,
2 May 94.

I fixed one last Black Screen Of Death problem in OS/2 C-K that occurred when
the screen was rolled back when nothing had yet been placed in the rollback
buffer.  ckocon.c 5A(143), 2 May 94.

Closed a potential memory leak that could occur when collecting a debug log
during a TELNET connection.  ckcnet.c, 2 May 94.

Fixed HP-UX 10.0 support to use HDB-style, rather than SVR4-style, UUCP
lockfile names.  ckutio.c 5A(130), 3 May 94.

Fixed SET TERMINAL CHARACTER-SET <remote> [ <local> ], in the OS/2 version,
to default the <local> character set to the current code page, if known.
ckuus7.c, 3 May 94.

Added a few #includes to ttgwsiz() in ckutio.c to allow compilation under
SCO UNIX 3.2v4.0, from William Bader <wbader@csee.lehigh.edu>, ckutio.c
5A(130), 3 May 94.  Also from William, some ANSIfication in ckufio.c.

An SCO UNIX 3.2v4.1-related fix to the sco32v4net makefile entry (the
addition of -D_IBCS2 to CFLAGS, so make the winsize structure in termio.h
be defined) from Han Holl <100327.1632@compuserve.com>.  3 May 94.  Also,
at Han's suggestion, ANSIfied the declarations of dodebug() and tlog() in
ckuusx.c, to suppress complaints.

Added support for the DECHEBM escape sequence, CSI ? 35 h/l, to OS/2 C-Kermit.
Upon receipt of CSI ? 35 h, it executes the macro KEYBOARDS, which must be
defined by the user.  Upon receipt of CSI ? 35 l, it executes the macro
KEYBOARDR.  This is just like in MS-DOS Kermit 3.13, and allows host-initiated
switching of keyboard mode, e.g. between English and Hebrew.  The KEYBOARD[RS]
macros, presumably, contain a bunch of SET KEY commands.  After actually using
this with the ALEPH software, however, I discovered it was intolerably slow
and irritating -- ALEPH sends *lots* of DECHEBM commands, and so Kermit's
screen was constantly blacking out, etc.  So I switched to a hardwired
approach -- very fast, no blinking, but also not remappable by the user.
We'll see what people think about it...  ckocon.[ch] 5A(144), 4 May 94.

Added skeleton for named pipe support to OS/2 C-Kermit.
ckcnet.h defines PIPENAML to be maximum length of server name.
ckuus3.c defines char pipename[PIPENAML], parsers SET NETWORK NAMED-PIPE
<pipename>, sets nettype to NET_PIPE, and stores pipename in pipename[].
ckuus7.c, routine setlin(), adds SET HOST <servername> if nettype is NET_PIPE,
and constructs \\pipename\pipe\serverename in ttname, to be passed to ttopen().
If Kermit is to be a named-pipe server, awaiting a connection, the user must
type SET NET NAMED-PIPE <servername>, SET HOST *.  Jeff A will fill in
the supporting code in cko???.?.  5 May 94.

Changed SET TERM TYPE ANSI to give appropriate warning message if it could
not change code page to 437.  ckuus7.c, 5 May 94.

Rec'd named pipe support routines from Jeff Altman:  ckonet.[ch], ckotio.c,
corrections to ckuus[37].c.  NOTE: Named pipe support is only for the 32-bit
version -- MSC chokes on undefined symbols, etc, in ckonet.c.  6 May 94.

Fixed SHOW NET to display named-pipe info.  ckuus4.c, 6 May 94.

Fixed TELNET command to work right after a previous SET NET NAMED-PIPE
command.  ckuusr.c, 6 May 94.

HP-UX 9.03, 6 May 94:
 . Added new makefile entry, hpux90, to be used with restricted HP compiler.
 . Enabled RTS/CTS, REDIRECT, Kanji, so now it's a full version.
 . Added custom version herald.
 . Checked uucp lockfile -- it's ok.
 . Added CK_POLL.
 . Added RENAME.
 . Added more \v(cpu) tests (for model 700, etc).
 . With all the above new features, stripped executable = 626K.
 . Tried unrestricted C compiler:
     OK with -O (= +O2), stripped executable = 495K
     OK with +O3, stripped executable = 512K (bigger because of inlining)
     Not ok with +Obb780.
     (+Obb780 = +O2, 780 max number of basic blocks)
 . Tried ANSI compilation with "KFLAGS=-Aa -CK_ANSIC -D_HPUX_SOURCE":
     It died right away.
 . Tested modem communications:
     Works great with RTS/CTS, DIALs OK, etc etc.
     Passes ripple & download tests at 57600 bps over V.32bis.
     Gets about 2200 cps on Kermit transfer of text files.
     But does not pop back to prompt automatically upon loss of carrier.
 . Tested direct serial communications:
     Null modem cable from tty00 to tty01, getty on tty01.
     Loses characters at 115200 bps, even with RTS/CTS turned on.
     Works perfectly at 57600 bps, gets about 5100 cps on text file xfers.
     Does not seem to detect any modem signals.
 . NOTE: Program must not be installed setuid or setgid to root.

Added Hebrew-keyboard-mode indication to OS/2 C-Kermit status line: "-H" is
appended to the terminal-type when the keyboard is in Hebrew mode, e.g.
"VT220-H".  Also fixed reset function to clear (reset) Hebrew mode.
ckocon.c 5A(145), 7 May 94.

Fixed the annoying problem with the beginning of file-transfer error messages
being cut off, which has been there for years.  Mostly in ckcfn2.c -- created
a separate buffer, pktmsg, for these messages.  Allocated in ckcfn3.c,
declared in ckcmai.c, used in ckcfn2.c and ckcpro.w.  7 May 94.

Added a local option to the OS/2 named-pipe support, "SET HOST .", which
allows users (like me) who don't have Named Pipe support installed on their
PCs to still use this feature for connections between two C-Kermit processes
on the same computer, e.g. for testing stuff.  ckonet.c 5A(013), 7 May 94.

Defined POSIX_CRTSCTS for NetBSD, from Mike Long.  ckcdeb.h, 8 May 94.

Documented modem initialization strings for several modems that are not
directly supported by C-Kermit's DIAL command: AT&T DataPort 14400, Boca 14.4
Faxmodem, Hayes Ultra 144, Multitech MT1432, Practical Peripherals 14400FXMT,
Zoom Telephonics 14400.  ckcker.bwr, 8 May 94.  Added a sample to the OS/2
section of CKERMOD.INI.

New code for OS/2 from Jeff Altman, 8 May 94:
 . Beginnings of mouse support, not turned on.
 . Beginnings of NETBIOS support, not turned on.
 . New ttoci() uses DosWrite(), but checks connection first.
 . Fix for Named Pipe buffering.

Added command-level support for SET NET NETBIOS, SET TERMINAL MOUSE, including
HELP, SHOW NET, SHOW TERMINAL, SHOW FEATURES, etc.  Lots of files.  8 May 94.

Tested new OS/2 ttoci() on a 57600-bps serial connection thru a non-buffered
UART with TERMINAL OUTPUT-PACING set to 0 -- works great: does not get blocked
at all when typing, using F or arrow keys, using keys that have long strings
assigned to them, and even when pasting massive amounts of text into the
window.  But it still does give the TRANSMISSION BLOCKED indication if, for
example, RTS/CTS is in effect and the modem turns off CTS.  And it still pops
back to the prompt if CD drops.  So I changed the default TERMINAL
OUTPUT-PACING to be 0 (no pacing!) instead of -1, and changed CKCKER.UPD
accordingly.

Also tested Named Pipe support -- works much better -- file transfers with
4 window slots x 2K-byte packets go without a hitch.

Fixed OS/2 VT emulator's newline-mode to go by the book (DEC VT220
programmer's manual): "Causes a received LF, FF, or VT code to move the cursor
to the first column of the next line."  Also fixed CR-DISPLAY CRLF to echo a
linefeed locally (as well as a CR) when TERMINAL ECHO is LOCAL.  Also
straightened out a small mess with SO/SI.  Also documented the flow of
incoming data in the source code.  Also discovered that code-paging switching
doesn't work in a window.  ckocon.c 5A(146), 8 May 94.

Added SIGTSTP suspend support to HP-UX 9.0 and later versions.  ckutio.c
5A(131), 9 May 94.

Added parsing for SET NET NETBIOS <name> and SET HOST for NETBIOS.  ckcnet.h,
ckuus[37].c, 9 May 94.

Howie Kaye <howie@columbia.edu> discovered a bug in REINPUT (it was matching
things it shouldn't have been).  He also noticed that it was not possible to
refer to \%letter variables in uppercase, e.g. \%A.  Both fixed in ckuus4.c,
9 May 94.

Fixed HP-UX 9.0 ANSI + optimizing compilation.  ckufio.c, makefile.  10 May 94.

Fixed some glitches in the CRT and FULLSCREEN file transfer display during
and/or after RESEND operations.  12 May 94.

Steve Walton enabled RESEND for the Amiga version.  Defined CK_RESEND in
ckcdeb.h for the Amiga.  16 May 94.

New set of Stratus-VOS-specific files from David Lane
<David_Lane@vos.stratus.com>, 16 May 94.

After an extended debugging session with Jeff Altman, it was determined that
LINK386 2.01.012 or later is needed to build 32-bit OS/2 C-Kermit; otherwise
we get garbage like two variables allocated to the same storage, etc.
16 May 94.

New ckotio.c, ckocon.c, ckoker.mak files from Jeff Altman with mouse support
and keyboard buffering added, removal of critical sections, now replaced by
threads.  Also, I fixed a bug with DEC line-drawing characters that I
introduced in May 8th's cleanup.  This is Alpha.11, dated 18 May 94.

Changed E-PACKET command to always send packet 0 with block-check type 1.
Otherwise there's a good chance the other Kermit won't be able to read it.
ckcmai.c, ckcpro.w, ckuusr.c.  19 May 94.

Changed PCGET macro (APC version) in CKERMIT.INI to account for the
possibility that the requested file might not exist on the other end.
19 May 94.

After wiping out my connection once too often by accident, I decided to make
SET EXIT WARNING also apply to SET HOST, SET LINE, SET PORT, and TELNET
commands.  ckuus[r37].c, ckuusr.h.  20 May 94.

While reading code in cmifi() - input filename parser - I noticed that it
could return without freeing malloc'd memory.  Fixed in ckucmd.c, 19 May 94.

Changed the OS/2 CD command to allow unquoted backslashes in directory
names.  cmdir() in ckucmd.c 5A(060), 20 May 94.

Ditto for input file parsing in cmifi() and output file parsing in cmofi() in
ckucmd.c.  I also added special cases for IF EXIST and IF DIRECTORY in
ckuus6.c.

In cmdir() and cmifi(), Kermit now tries to parse the string as a file or
directory name literally.  If it succeeds, fine; if not, then it passes the
string through the variable-expander (xxstring()) and tries again.  In
cmofi(), the process is somewhat different: the string is scanned to see if
contains C-Kermit variable or function names, and if it does, it is evaluated;
otherwise it is taken literally.  The reason for this is that C-Kermit
variable names can easily be legal OS/2 filenames; "receive \%a" could create
a file called %A in the root directory.

The previous syntax (using / or \\ as the directory separator) continues to
work.

The new scheme follows the "principle of least astonishment" for regular
users, but might confound (a very small number of) diehard script programmers;
the rules are spelled out in the OS/2 section of CKCKER.UPD, along with
techniques that script programmers can use for resolving ambiguities.

Fixed the DIRECTORY, TYPE, and DELETE commands in OS/2 C-Kermit to work when
given a filespec that contains a directory field.  This never worked before.
Also, changed the DIRECTORY command to accept trailing switches to be passed
to OS/2, like "directory c:\temp\foo.* /p /o-d", as well as output redirection,
so now it accepts almost everything the OS/2 DIR command accepts, including
lone disk letters.  ckuusr.c, ckuus6.c, ckucmd.c, 20-21 May 94.

Added some text about the mouse to OS/2 C-K HELP TERMINAL. ckuus2.c, 21 May 94.

Fixed the HELP command's "more?" prompter not to set the FAILURE flag if the
user says No.  This was causing command retry to kick in.  ckuus2.c, 21 May 94.

Work of 19-21 May installed as Alpha.12, 21 May 94.

Added a few lines of code to allow OS/2 C-Kermit to use up- and down arrow
keys for command recall, in command mode only.  ckotio.c 5A(135), ckuus2.c,
22 May 94.

Added CHECK RTS/CTS to let script programs check whether RTS/CTS flow
control is available before trying to use it.  ckuus3.c, 23 May 94.

Fixes for OS/2 C-K from Kai Uwe Rommel: a problem with Named Pipe connections;
SET DIAL DIRECTORY command parsing; REMOTE SPACE execution by OS/2 C-K server. 
ckcpro.w 5A(062), ckonet.c 5A(016), 25 May 94

Fixed CHECK command to show full name of feature, even if user only gave an
abbreviation, or used completion.  ckuus3.c, 25 May 94.

Added conditional assembly support to ckcmai.c and ckcnet.c for the SOCKS
Internet relay package, from Rainer Glaschik <glaschick.kd@sni.de>, Siemens,
Paderborn.  25 May 94.

Discovered that C-Kermit lost its mind if it tried to evaluate a variable
whose value was "\" (a single backslash).  Fixed in xxstring(), ckuus4.c,
25 May 94.

Added a new command: GETC.  Like ASK, but gets just a single character, with
no confirmation or editing; returns immediately when user pushes any key
(i.e. any key that can be read by coninc(0)).  ckuusr.h, ckuusr.c 5A(137),
ckuus6.c, 25 May 95.

Rec'd confirmation that OS/2 C-K works with FTP Software's PC/TCP from
Patrick W. Foster, Tech Support, FTP Software Inc., 2 High Street, North
Andover, MA  01845, pwf@ftp.com.

Call this one 5A(190) ALPHA.14 25 May 94.

Started working on HP-UX 10.0 makefile entry.  Added -DCK_POLL and -DCK_RENAME.
25 May 94.

Added EVALUATE command - trivial, since we already have the \feval() function.
ckuusr.h, ckuus2.c, ckuusr.c 5A(138), 26 May 94.

Kai Uwe Rommel sent in massive changes to the OS/2 version:
 . A new intermediate TCP/IP DLL now sits between Kermit and the real
   TCP/IP DLL (if any), so we no longer have to worry about whether or not
   to install the old "dummy" DLL.  The new DLL itself determines, at run
   time, whether TCP/IP is installed.  This change affects many CKO*.*
   modules, the makefile, etc.
 . The Rexx interface was changed to (a) remove the need for the
   CKCOMMAND command in Rexx programs, and (b) the need for the REXXFILE
   command in C-Kermit.

Jeff Altman integrated Kai Uwe's diffs and updated the install script
and the CKOREXX.DOC file.  He also did some more work on the mouse support,
but it isn't complete, so mouse support was disabled.

This is C-Kermit 5A(190) ALPHA.15, 1 June 1994.

New HP-UX 10.0 makefile entries for ANSI C optimizing compiler.  makefile,
4 Jun 94.

New OS/2 C-K mouse copy & paste support from Jeff Altman.  ckocon.c.  Also,
NETBIOS support cleanups -- even though this feature doesn't work yet, the
previous changes broke compilation; now at least it compiles again.  4 Jun 94.

ANSI prototyping fixes for HP-UX 10.0, ckufio.c, 5 Jun 94.

Discovered that "def \%a { foo }" did not produce the expected result, i.e.
strip the braces, keep the spaces.  Fixed in ckuus6.c.  5 Jun 94.

Fixed ttgmdm() to correctly report on Ring Indicator for HP-UX; ckutio.c
5A(132), 5 Jun 94.

Changed the protocol module to accept an I-packet when in RECEIVE mode.  It
does no harm, and helps the client recover quickly when it sends a REMOTE,
GET, FINISH, or BYE command to a non-server.  ckcpro.w 5A(063), 6 Jun 94.

For selected systems where we know it's safe to do this, I increased the
default maximum buffer size from 9K to 90K: SunOS 4.x, Solaris, HP-UX 10.0,
NeXTs, 32-bit OS/2, IRIX 4.0, VMS, etc.  ckcker.h, 6 Jun 94.

Fix to CKVFIO.C for zchki() to make it use private data structures, to
prevent unrelated input-file operations (e.g. OPEN READ) from interfering
with each other, from Terry Kennedy.  CKVTIO.C 2.0-110, 8 Jun 94.

New-&-improved mouse support for OS/2 from Jeff Altman.  ckocon.c 5A(150),
ckuus5.c, ckcdeb.h, 9 Jun 94.

Support added for WHATAMI field in protocol initialization string.  This
quietly helps get text/binary and similar items right in client/server
connections when both client and server support this feature by letting the
client's settings predominate.  No fanfare.  ckcker.h, ckcfns.c 5A(112),
ckcpro.w 5A(064), 8 Jun 94.

NETBIOS support added to OS/2 C-Kermit for IBM's LAN Adapter and Protocol
Support product (ACSNETB.DLL), but not yet for the Novell LAN Server / Netware
Requestor (NETAPI.DLL), by Jeff Altman.  Many modules.

From Terry Kennedy - a fix to allow VMS C-Kermit to construct an attribute
packet even if the VMS system does not have a rights database (which shouldn't
happen, but did).  ckvfio.c 2.0-111, 17 Jun 94.

The services directory has always used login macros (VMSLOGIN, UNIXLOGIN, etc)
that have their respective host prompts (such as \13\10$) hard-coded.  But
since prompts on VMS, UNIX, and other systems can differ (and are often
customized per site, or by the user), it would be preferable to include the
prompt as a parameter to the login macro.  However, there was no obvious way
to do this without changing the format of the services directory, which would
break existing services directories, and also because a services directory
already can have up to 9 fields, which is the maximum number of macro
arguments.  This was fixed in today's edition of CKERMIT.INI via what Baldric
would call a "cunning plan"...  The second item in a services directory entry
is the name of the login macro, such as:

  vmslogin

Now it can also, optionally, be the login macro name followed by the system
prompt, grouped by braces, as in:

  {vmslogin chemvax:\32}

Old services directories continue to work as before, in which case the default
(hardwired) prompt is looked for.  The new form can be used to specify a
non-default prompt.  ckermit.ini, 17 Jun 94.

Fixed DIAL command to catch the case where a dialing directory includes an
entry name but nothing else (i.e. no phone number).  ckuus6.c, 18 Jun 94.

Added -DCK_POLL to DG/UG 5.4 version.  makefile, 18 Jan 94.

Spent the day building and testing this version:
 . DEC 5800 MIPS Ultrix 4.2 - OK
 . DEC Alpha AXP OSF/1 1.3 - OK
 . DEC Alpha AXP OSF/1 2.0 - OK
 . DEC Alpha AXP OpenVMS 1.5 / MultiNet - OK
 . DEC Alpha AXP OpenVMS 1.5 / no net - OK
 . DG AViiON DG/UX 5.40 - OK
 . HP-9000/300 4.4BSD - OK
 . HP-9000/550 HP-UX 5.21 - OK
 . HP-9000/385 HP-UX 8.00 - OK
 . HP-9000/715 HP-UX 10.0 - OK
 . Linux 0.99.14 - OK
 . NeXT - OK
 . PC with OS/2 16- and 32-bit - OK
 . PC with UnixWare 1.1.1 - OK
 . Solaris 2.3 with gcc - OK
 . SunOS 4.1.3 - OK
 . SunOS 4.1.3 POSIX universe - OK

BUT...
 . DG AOS/VS version compiles and links OK, but does not work.  Various script
   commands (IF, OPEN READ) are mysteriously broken.  Discovered this was
   because of a misplaced #endif in the IF EXISTS / IF DIRECTORY code, which
   would have affected any C-Kermit version that did not have CK_TMPDIR
   defined.  Fixed 19 Jun 94.  Also fixed the AOS/VS CD command -- when given
   without an operand, it would fail because "homdir" ended in a colon.

 . PDP-11 2.11 BSD version is too big, again.  By 64 bytes in root segment.
   Tried getting rid of 81-byte pktmsg[] buffer, only for pdp11, in a
   disgusting hack in which it shares the user interface's tmpbuf[].  But that
   made no difference at all.  Removed E-PACKET fixes from May 19.  Still not
   small enough.  Added -DNOWHATAMI.  Finally built OK.  19 Jun 94.

Built VAX/VMS versions (no net, MultiNet, UCX) and Macintosh version.
19 Jun 94.

This is 5A(190) ALPHA.18, 16 Jun 94.

Updates to VMS makefile from Terry Kennedy to allow for linking on VMS systems
that have the new FORTRAN V6 library (don't ask), plus insertion of a warning
message in the generated CKVKER.COM file that it is generated automatically
from the makefile, and all changes should be made to the makefile itself.
20 Jun 94.

From Jeff Altman: maximum scrollback in OS/2 32-bit version 
increased from 4K lines to 2,000,000 lines = 512M max process memory / 132 / 2.
Plus numerous NETBIOS changes/fixes.  20 Jun 94.

Changed reporting ownership of UUCP lockfile in ttopen() in UNIX version.
Previously, if the device had a lockfile, ttopen() would try to print a
directory listing of the lockfile.  But if the lockfile directory was not
read-accessible to the user, Kermit would give a stupid message like:

  /var/spool/locks/LCK..tty00 not found
  Sorry, device is in use: /dev/tty00

This is because Kermit's own setuid/setgid privilege is/are not (and should
not be) passed along to ls.  Rather than building an entire ls program into
Kermit, I changed it to read the lockfile (since Kermit itself has the needed
privs), get the pid, if any, and display it.  The directory listing is now
attempted only if we fail to get a pid.  ckutio.c 5A(133), 22 Jun 94.

Fixed CKERMIT.INI login macros again; the previous fix broke the feature that
allows the password to be given on the macro command line.  22 Jun 94.

Fixed a bug in which a TERMINAL ECHO setting could be spuriously "restored" to
half duplex (local echo) upon return from a non-TELNET network CONNECT session
(e.g. Named Pipe or NETBIOS).  Discovered by Jeff Altman.
ckuus7.c 22 Jun 94.

Improvements in OS/2 NETBIOS support from Jeff Altman.  ckonbi.[ch],
ckuus[3x].c.

This is 5A(190) BETA.01, 22 Jun 94, 11:30pm EST.

Fixes to OS/2 NETBIOS support from Jeff Altman, ckuus[3x].c (these were
including <os2.h>, but <os2.h> #defines COMMENT, which turns on all the
commented-out code in these modules).  Also, improvements to OS/2 mouse
support, ckocon.c 5A(152), 23 June 94, 8:00am EST.  Today's changes affect
only the OS/2 version.

This is 5A(190) BETA.02, 23 Jun 94.

Small change to ckcdeb.h to allow compilation on DECstation with Mach 2.6,
which has the same "union wait" "feature" as the NeXT, from Paul Placeway.
23 Jun 94.

Changed REMOTE SET FILE TYPE to also set the local file type correspondingly,
to help prevent surprises when WHATAMI takes effect.  ckuus7.c, 24 Jun 94.

Allow OS/2 C-Kermit server to respond to REMOTE WHO (it just sends back
a string saying it's an OS/2 C-Kermit server).  Jeff Altman, ckufio.c
5A(089), 25 Jun 94.

Numerous fixes and cleanups for OS/2 C-Kermit from Jeff Altman, primarily
moving mouse support to its own module, ckomou.c, because ckocon.obj was
getting too big for the linker, which resulted in runtime errors.  Many cko*
modules.  Also, Jeff updated the mouse and NETBIOS material, and other OS/2
specifics, in CKCKER.UPD and CKOKER.BWR.  25 Jun 94.

Made Interactive UNIX #include <sys/stream.h> and <sys/ptem.h> for picking up
TIOCGWINSZ structure member declarations.  Problem reported by Kenneth W
Cochran.  25 Jun 94.

Made a scad of new UNIX makefile entries to differentiate HP-UX 9.0x on the
model 800 (where poll() is not available) from all other models (where poll()
*is* available), using a new compile-time symbol NOPOLL, which overrides
CK_POLL.  makefile, 25 Jun 94.

Added a new symbol, LINUXFSSTND, which can be used in Linux compilations to
select the "new" (ho hum) lockfile conventions (/var/lock/LCK..name, decimal
ASCII 10-byte PID string with leading zeros) rather than the "old" ones
(/usr/spool/uucp/LCK..name, int PID).  Suggested by Phil Keegstra
<keegstra@aruba.gsfc.nasa.gov>.  ckutio.c 5A(135), 25 Jun 94.  

Fixed a problem in the Data General AOS/VS version, reported by Cory Sane
<sane@musc.edu>, namely that if Kermit failed to find CKERMIT.INI in the
user's home directory, it should (and used to) look in the user's searchlist,
but this was broken in edit 190 (when I made a change that I thought affected
only UNIX).  Old behavior restored in ckuusr.c 5A(140), ckuus5.c, 25 Jun 94.  

Also, at Cory's suggestion, added RESEND capability to AOS version.  This was
simply a matter of copying the zfseek() routine from the UNIX version and
defining CK_RESEND at compile time.  ckdfio.c 5A(066) 25 Jun 94;

This is 5A(190) BETA.03, 25 Jun 94.

Fixed indexing in UNIX man page.  26 Jun 94.

Got VMS C-Kermit makefile additions and corrections from Bernie Volz
<VOLZ@PROCESS.COM> for Process Software TCPware on the VAX and the Alpha AXP,
plus C-Kermit binaries for those two combinations.  These same binaries also
run under UCX and, presumably also under TGV MultiNet, which has a UCX
compatibility mode...  There is also a small change to ckuus4.c for SHOW NET.
I also learned that the CKVHEX program can be run on a VAX to make a hex file
out of an AXP binary.  27 Jun 94.

Discovered that the DEC OSF/1 2.0 C compiler generates bad code if
optimization is used.  Created a new makefile entry, dec-osf20, for this,
which omits optimization.  makefile.  27 Jun 94.

Eduard Vopicka in the Czech Republic added code to enable hardware flow
control for SCO UNIX 3.2.something-or-other == ODT 3.0.  It worked fine for
turning RTS/CTS ON, but RTS/CTS did not get turned off when FLOW was set back
to NONE or XON/XOFF after having been set to RTS/CTS.  This turns out to be my
fault.  So, more rearranging of tthflow() in ckutio.c, 5A(136), 27 Jun 94,
plus adding in Eduard's code.  The result compiles OK on SunOS, UnixWare,
HP-UX, etc, but needs testing.

Fix from Jeff Altman for OS/2 C-Kermit TCP/IP sessions.
ckonet.c 5A(018), 27 Jun 94.

This is 5A(190) BETA.04, 27 Jun 94.

For better debugging, rearranged things to make the "-d" command-line
option take effect first thing, rather than waiting until after sysinit()
is called.  ckcker.h, ckcmai.c, ckuus4.c.  28 Jun 94.

Changes for SET FLOW KEEP for OS/2 from Kai Uwe.  He discovered a device
(a radio clock) that gets power from the RTS line, which must be low. 
Previously, OS/2 C-Kermit always set RTS high.  Now SET FLOW KEEP leaves it
alone.  ckotio.c 5A(136), 28 Jun 94.

At the urging of Eduard Vopicka <Eduard.Vopicka@vse.cz>, added APC code to the
UNIX version.  But it doesn't work because of the two-forks business (memory
is not shared, data is changed in the wrong fork).  Eduard might take a look
at using pipes, etc.  28 Jun 94.

Added End-of-Attributes attribute ("@ ") to end of A packet.  sattr(),
ckcfn3.c.  ckcfns.c 5A(113), 29 Jun 94.

Raised maximum window size from 31 to 32.  The proof that this may be safely
done is left as an exercise for the reader.  ckcker.h, ckcfns.c, ckuus3.c,
29 Jun 94.

More OS/2 Netbios fixes from Jeff Altman.  ck[co]net.c, 29 Jun 94.
And again, 30 Jun 94.

It turns out that some UNIX versions that are not based on System V R4
nevertheless implement RTS/CTS flow control via <[sys/]termiox.h>, e.g.
HP-UX 9.0.  So I removed the #ifdef SVR4..#endif around the [S]TERMIOX
section in ckutio.c.  1 Jul 94.

Due to a typo in ckcdeb.h, REXX support disappeared from the 32-bit OS/2
version in Beta.04.  Now fixed, 1 Jul 94.

Eduard Vopicka changed ckucon.c to use a pipe for all types of communication
between the upper and lower fork.  This enabled the APC code to function in
the UNIX version -- the lower fork sends the APC command to the upper one by
interrupting it with SIGUSR1 and then sending a function code and the APC
string through the pipe.  This eliminates the need for SIGUSR2.  I cleaned up,
debugged, and rearranged the code a bit, but it still has a few minor glitches
(e.g. unpredictability of messages, sometimes you have to hit Return to get
back, etc), and so I have not added -DCK_APC to any of the makefile entries.
Use at your own risk.  Without CK_APC defined, ckucon.c should operate as
before, but with the pipe.

This is 5A(190) BETA.05, 1 Jul 94.

From Jeff Altman: ckotio.c 5A(137), ckonet.c 5A(020), and ckonbi.c 5A(004),
with corrections affecting NETBIOS and, to some degree, other networking
methods in OS/2 C-Kermit.  2 Jul 94.

Added "resend" and "psend" indications to fullscreen file transfer display.
Also added some small fixes involving too-long names, from Bill Glass
<glass@vixvax.mgi.com>.  ckuusx.c, 2 Jul 94.

More work on APC for UNIX.  Ensured that when TERM APC is OFF, that the APC
is passed through transparently, so if UNIX C-Kermit is "in the middle", in
CONNECT mode, that an APC sent from the remote host will be visible to the
most local computer, e.g. MS-DOS Kermit or whatever on your desktop PC.

Ensured that APC ON does not interfere with character-set translation, neither
7-bit national character sets, nor 8-bit sets.  However, note that when
transferring files through C-Kermit "in the middle", in CONNECT mode, this
Kermit (the one in the middle) better have its TERMINAL CHARACTER-SET set to
TRANSPARENT; otherwise, the packets will be changed on their way through and
the transfer will fail.

Noted that pipe() is supposedly available in all versions of UNIX, and that
the smallest maximum amount of stuff that can be written to a pipe is
something like 4K, whereas an APC sequence can never be more than about 1K.
Built C-Kermit on a bunch of different UNIX systems (NeXT, SunOS, SVR4, etc)
with APC enabled with no apparent problems in compilation, linking, or
execution.  So I defined CK_APC by default for all UNIX versions that are also
built with the script programming (i.e. for which NOSPL is not defined).
ckuusr.h, 2 Jul 94.

There is still one problem with UNIX APC: Any characters that come in on the
communication line while the APC commands are being executed are lost.  This
does not happen in the OS/2 version.  But this doesn't happen in UNIX version
when APC is not involved -- if you escape back to the C-Kermit prompt while
the remote end is generating output, it will be saved up (given buffer
capacity, flow control, etc) for when you next CONNECT.

Added APC support to VMS C-Kermit.  This was much easier, since the CONNECT
command does not run in two forks.  It works, but has exactly the same problem
as the UNIX version: losing the remote Kermit's next prompt upon reconnecting.
To be figured out tomorrow...  CKVCON.C 5A(034), 2 Jul 94.

Noticed that spurious "Type escape character (^\) followed by..." message
was still being given in cases where it wasn't needed when the file transfer
display was not fullscreen.  Fixed in ckuusx.c, 3 Jul 94.

While looking at the previous problem, I realized that there was a lot of
inconsistency and overlap between ttchk() and conchk() in ckutio.c.  So I
created a new (static) routine, in_chk(), which replaces both of them, and
adds new methods of checking to each, including select(), which had never been
used here before.  Addition of select() covers HP-UX systems prior to 9.0,
which previously were not covered (I checked the oldest HP-UX system I have
access to, 5.21, and it had select()).  But then after building and testing
the new code on HP-UX, I discovered that all HP-UX versions also had FIONREAD,
which is preferable to select() because it returns not only the state of the
read buffer, but the number of bytes in it.  The new in_chk() routine is
structured to use FIONREAD, if it is available, in preference to select(),
poll(), rdchk(), or other methods, because FIONREAD gives not just a yes/no
status, but the actual number of characters waiting.  This is a major
improvement for HP-UX and probably many others -- not only does it make
local-mode file transfer interruption easier, but it makes sliding windows
work better (see notes above from Oct 25, 93).  In doing this, I also got rid
of usleep() in the SunOS, NeXTSTEP, and BSDI, versions, replacing it by
select(), in msleep().  Also, I moved the compile "logic" (#ifdefs) for
deciding about all this to ckcdeb.h, so it would be available at all times to
all modules, and added display of their status to SHOW FEATURES.  makefile,
ckcdeb.h, ckuus5.c, ckutio.c 5A(137), 3 Jul 94.

Since HP-UX doesn't need CK_POLL any more, I removed all the HP-UX 9.0
model-800 specific makefile entries that I added a few days ago to account for
poll() not being available on the 800 series.  I also removed it from the
HP-UX 10.0 entries.  Also added -DRENAME to HP-UX 8.0 makefile entries, and
cleaned them up.  Tested on HP-UX 5.21, 8.0, 9.03, and 10.0.
makefile, 3 Jul 94.

Noticed that file dates weren't recorded correctly by 4.4BSD (BSDI, etc) when
receiving files.  This is because there was no code in zstime() in ckufio.c
to adjust for the timezone.  After some digging, I found out how to do it
and added the needed code.  Tested on BSD4.4-Lite and BSDI 1.0.  It won't work
(obviously) if the system does not have its timezone set correctly, but
otherwise it seems fine.  ckufio.c 5A(090), 3 Jul 94.

Linus Torvalds told me that Linux supports both select() and FIONREAD, so I
defined SELECT for all Linux builds, allowing it to be used in (at least)
msleep().  FIONREAD is not available on Linux 0.99.14.  I'm not sure which was
the first release to have it, but if Kermit is built on a system that has
FIONREAD defined in <sys/ioctl.h> (?), then it will be used by in_chk().  In
any event, the Linux version now has a working in_chk(), and so users no
longer have to precede local-mode file-transfer interruption characters with
the CONNECT-mode escape character, and sliding-window transfers will work
better now.  ckcdeb.h, ckutio.c 5A(138), 4 Jul 94.

Removed -DUSLEEP from Linux makefile entries, fixed the static-linking Linux
entries (which never worked before), and consolidated all the Linux entries
into linux, linuxs, linuxtcp, linuxtcps.  makefile, 4 Jul 94.

Discovered that UnixWare 1.1.1 supports select() too, but didn't do anything
about because who knows about 1.1, 1.0, etc, and it already uses poll(), so
who cares.

Rearranged and fixed the Linux hi-speed stuff again, via suggestions from
Alan Modra <alan@spri.levels.unisa.edu.au>.  I also got rid of the messages
telling about LINUX_HI_SPEED or ASYNC_SPD_MASK.  It turns out that it does no
harm to always build Linux C-Kermit with high speeds enabled.  If the
underlying Linux version does not support a high speed, the corresponding
SET SPEED command will fail (tested on Linux 0.99.14).  If it turns out I'm
wrong, you can add -DNOHISPEED to CFLAGS.  ckcdeb.h, makefile, ckutio.c,
6 Jul 94.

Minor changes for SCO Xenix 2.2.3 & 2.2.4 with Excelan and Lachman TCP/IP,
respectively, from William Bader.  6 Jul 94.

Fixed prescan() to compile OK with -DNODEBUG, change from Douglas Boyce
<ak272@freenet.buffalo.edu>.  ckuus4.c, 6 Jul 94.

Changed OS/2 default flow control from KEEP to NONE, because KEEP no longer
explicitly turns on Request To Send (RTS), but all the other methods do.  This
was preventing communication from taking place at all for some people
(reported by Bob Babcock).  ckotio.c 5A(138), 6 Jul 94.

Made separate keyword tables for SET FILE TYPE and REMOTE SET FILE TYPE.  On
VMS, OS/2, etc, users should not be allowed to REMOTE SET FILE TYPE LABELED or
other system-specific types -- only TEXT and BINARY.  Thanks to Max Evarts for
noticing this anomoly.  Also, hooked SET SESSION-LOG into the REMOTE table,
since TEXT and BINARY should be the only combinations.  Also, made ASCII an
invisible synonym for TEXT.  ckuus3.c, ckuus7.c, 6 Jul 94.

More fixes to OS/2 NETBIOS support from Jeff Altman, ckonet.c, 6 Jul 94.

Minor ANSIfications to CKVFIO.C and ckcnet.c for VMS with GCC, from James
Sturdevant <sturdeva@watsun.cc.columbia.edu>.  CKVFIO.C 5A(112),
ckcnet.c, 8 Jul 94.

Added code, but left it commented out, for setting socket buffer size for
TCP/IP connections, from William Bader <wbader@csee.lehigh.edu>.
ckcnet.c 5A(032), 8 Jul 94.

Eduard Vopicka pointed out that problems with UNIX APC losing characters might
be exacerbated by the arrangement of the two CONNECT forks.  But we can't
switch to using select() in one fork, because select() is not portable.  Nor
can we use lightweight processes, shared memory, threads, etc, for the same
reason.  The current structure (top fork reads/sends keystrokes, bottom fork
reads/displays communications device input) was chosen arbitrarily about 10
years ago, and we have built upon it ever since.

One problem with the CONNECT module is that it clears its internal buffers
(ibuf, obuf) and pointers (ibp, obp) every time it is entered.  So I
rearranged the code to ensure that these buffers and pointers are allocated
and set only upon first entry.  This way, if we read (for example) an APC
escape sequence followed by the subsequent prompt into the CONNECT command's
internal buffer, we don't clear out the material after the escape sequence
in the act of popping back to the command parser.  This won't help with UNIX
because of the fork problem, but to test this hypothesis, I rearranged the VMS
CONNECT module (one fork) to behave this way.  And now it works.

In the UNIX version, the upper and lower forks have their own private copies
of the communications-device input buffer, ibuf[].  If the lower fork exits
with characters remaining in ibuf[], they are lost.  This could be fixed, as
Eduard Vopicka suggests, reversing the forks.  Let's say the fork that reads
the keyboard and sends the keystrokes is the called KEYB fork, and the fork
that reads from the communications device and displays on the screen is called
the PORT fork.  Currently, the PORT fork is the lower fork.

 1. The PORT fork can get a disconnect indication when trying to read from
    the communications device, and it must inform the KEYB fork.  Likewise,
    the KEYB fork can get a disconnect indication when trying to send to
    the communications device, and it must kill the PORT fork.  The same
    would be true if the forks were reversed.

 2. The PORT fork gets incoming TELNET negotiations, and so it must inform the
    KEYB fork of echoing changes, since the KEYB fork is responsible for
    echoing.  Thus, no matter what the arrangement of the forks, the two must
    keep their echoing status in sync.

 3. The PORT fork gets X.25 PAD parameters, so it must convey them to the KEYB
    fork because the KEYB fork uses them all.

 4. The PORT fork gets the APC escape sequence, and must convey it to the
    command parser.  It also may have read ahead, and so therefore must not
    destroy the low-level communications input buffer.

If the forks were reversed, we would still need signals from the lower to the
upper fork in cases 1-3.  We would still need to send data through pipes in
cases 2 and 3, but from top to bottom rather than vice versa.  So we would
gain nothing in simplicity of structure.  Tons of code would need to be
rearranged and tested.  The ramifications could be far-reaching, the effort
and risk great, and the benefits by no means assurred.  So no reversing the
forks.

A simpler solution was found: the lower fork, upon detecting the end of an APC
sequence, first flushes its output buffer to refresh the screen (ckcputf), and
then passes the values of its input buffer pointers (ibp), count (ipc), and
contents (ipc characters starting at ibp) to the upper fork through the pipe.
We know that no characters are sitting in the lower level ck*tio.c buffers,
because the last call to ckcgetc() got all that there were.  Any other
characters that have arrived from the host in the interim are still in the
operating system's buffers, and we can still read them later.  Now since ibp,
ipc, and ibuf (as of today) stay put from one conect() invocation to the next,
the CONNECT command will pick up exactly where it left off previously, with
the next newly-created lower fork inheriting the correct buffer counts,
pointers, and contents from the upper fork.  The only glitch seems to be that
when the APC commands include an ECHO command, sometimes the first character
of the echoed text is lopped.  ckucon.c 5A(065), 8 Jul 94.

Glitch fixed.  The problem was that we always would output the Esc character
that starts an APC sequence, because we did not yet know it was going to be an
APC.  This would cause bizzare effects in the terminal emulator or window,
since any character at all could show up after the APC sequence.  So now, when
APC processing is enabled (i.e. SET TERM APC is not OFF), we hang on to the
Esc character until the next character arrives; if it is not the APC
introducer (underscore), then we output the Esc before outputting the next
character.  If it is the APC introducer, we process the entire APC sequence
internally, including the Escape.  ckucon.c 5A(066), 9 Jul 94.

Migrated today's changes to the VMS version.  CKVCON.C 5A(035), 9 Jul 94.

From Jeff Altman, more fixes and improvements to OS/2 NETBIOS support,
including enabling of sliding-window transfers, plus a new OS/2 makefile.
9 Jul 94.

Installed LINK386 2.01.016 on my OS/2 system, which fixes a stack problem
that was causing OS/2 C-Kermit to crash when the mouse was used.  9 Jul 94.

Added REDIRECT command for Linux.  ckcdeb.h, 9 Jul 94.

Tried adding -DSELECT for Solaris, but it seemed to screw things up; put it
back to how it was, using poll().  Tried "#define FIONREAD FIORDCHK" for
Solaris, but that REALLY did not work.  In case anybody ever asks you,
FIORDCHK != FIONREAD.

Built new OS/2 C-Kermits, 16 and 32 bit, with above fixes and new linker.

And new VMS C-Kermits, VAX and AXP, UCX and TGV.  And new UNIX C-Kermits:
SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.3, NeXTSTEP 3.1, Linux, UnixWare, HP-UX, etc, working
out glitches long the way.

(Note: still need to test -DNOCSETS, -DNOAPC, -DNOESCSEQ, etc...)

(Note: still need to fix up X.25 code in ckucon.c...)

This is Beta.07, 9 Jul 94.

Noticed that when TELNETing from Linux or Solaris (System-V-style signal
handling) to NeXTSTEP (which has a bizarre TELNET server that sends lots of
echo changes when you first connect to it, probably 3 or 4 within a couple
microseconds), that when the TELNET server breaks the connection, Kermit would
hang.  Turns out that this was caused by our nice new pipeint() routine and
consolidation of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.  The problem was that we were trying to
read from a pipe (to handle the duplex change) after the port fork was already
pause()'d.  So I went back to having two signal handlers, one for
disconnections (forkint() on SIGUSR1) and the other for mode-change messages
to be read from the lower fork through the pipe (pipeint() on SIGUSR2).  This
fixed the problem on both Solaris and Linux.

However, Linux is having one heck of a time handling SIGUSR2s...  Signals do
not seem to be delivered reliably, or else they are not blocked while being
handled.  When TELNETing to the NeXT, Linux C-Kermit almost always gets the
echoing wrong because Linux can't seem to handle the repeated SIGUSR2 signals
caused by rapid-fire echoing changes without dropping some.  The pre-APC
version of ckucon.c had exactly the same problem on Linux so we can't blame it
on the new code.  Hopefully, this won't affect anybody, ha ha.

Ha ha indeed.  Next I tried the new code on Unixware.  Upon TELNETing to a
NeXT, it politely said "User signal 2" and then Kermit's upper fork simply
vanished, leaving the lower CONNECT fork merrily spinning away, like a
headless chicken.  Evidently, the default action for SIGUSR2 in Unixware is to
_exit().  This problem turns out to be present also for earlier versions -- it
was evidently *never* possible to TELNET from C-Kermit on Unixware to a NeXT.

To fix, I began by putting signal(SIGUSRx,SIG_IGN)'s everywhere (program
startup in sysinit(), CONNECT exit code, etc) to ensure these signals are
never armed when Kermit's handler is not ready.  When pipeint() gets SIGUSR2,
it rearms it immediately as its first statement.  Thus there is only the
tiniest possible window during which a SIGUSR2 is caught and the time at which
it is re-armed -- i.e. the time that it takes to execute the signal() call.
Nevertheless, this problem will occur about 50% of the time when TELNET'ing
with C-Kermit from Unixware to a NeXT.  In looking at Unixware <signal.h>, I
see that SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, normally 30 and 31, have different values: 16
and 17, which are more often used (on other systems) for such items as SIGURG
and SIGSTOP.  Then I discovered that in Linux, the values are 10 and 12.  I
wonder if that's the trouble...  No.  Logs reveal that when TELNET'ing to a
normal kind of host, like a Sun, pipeint() gets invoked as expected and works
properly.

OK, so back to Linux.  After having honed this code down to the bone, I ran
it again on Linux and found:

  CONNECT TELNET duplex change=0
  pipeint arg=12
  pi** PORT=255 <-- Aha! pipeint is interrupted before it can do anything.

It read the function code from the pipe, but was interrupted before it
could (a) finish writing the debug entry (which should have said "pipeint
code=3"), and (b) execute the function, i.e. change duplex.  And again:

  TELNET SENT DONT ECHO=1
  CONNECT TELNET duplex change=1
  pipeint arg=12
  pi** PORT=13   <-- And again.
  ...
  tn_doop returns=2
  CONNECT TELNET duplex change=0
  pipeint arg=12
  pCKCGETC 1 calling ttinc(0)  <-- And again.

So the (disgusting, bleh) solution is for the lower fork, after signalling a
duplex change to the upper fork, to sleep for a few hundred milliseconds.
This should be totally transparent to the user, because, after all, how often
could it possibly happen during a telnet session?  This change makes the
Linux version echo correctly, and it seems to fix the Unixware situation too.

All this: ckucon.c 5A(067), 10 Jul 94.

This is Beta.08, 10 Jul 94.  The changes from 07 to 08 are strictly specific
to UNIX.

From Mark <markd@sco.com>, who works at SCO...  He says that RTS/CTS
(CK_RTSCTS) and Sys V R3 Job Control (SVR3JC) can safely be added to all SCO
UNIX 3.2v4 makefile entries.  makefile, 11 Jul 94.  Also, a fix for a typo in
ckucon.c which breaks compilation when DYNAMIC is not defined, reported by
Mark and many others.  11 Jul 94.

Changed default SET TERMINAL APC in OS/2 from ON to OFF for security reasons.
ckuus5.c, 13 Jul 94.

Jeff Altman cured a problem in OS/2 C-Kermit, in which the system could hang
under certain conditions during execution of spawned subprocesses. 
ckufio.c 5A(091), 13 Jul 94.

Also from Jeff, more improvements to the OS/2 Netbios code.  Now long-packet
sliding-window transfers go very smoothly over Netbios.
ckonbio.c 5A(006), ckonet.c 5A(023), 13 Jul 94.

Also from Jeff, updates to the OS/2 makefile.  ckoker.mak, 13 Jul 94.

This is Beta.09.

Fixed CKETEST.INI to be able to TAKE CKEDEMO.INI even if it is not being
executed from the current directory, as long as it is in the same directory
that CKETEST.INI was TAKEn from, using a diabolical trick involving
\freverse(\v(cmdfile))...  CKETEST.INI, 14 Jul 94.

More NetBios fixes from Jeff, plus a fix for an off-by-one error in the
file transfer display.  ckonbi.c, ckonet.c, ckuusx.c, 14 Jul 94.

Made OS/2 C-Kermit screen writes during execution of REMOTE commands be
unbuffered to alleviate jerkiness.  ckcfns.c, 14 Jul 94.

Added \v(ftype) = file type ("text", "binary", etc).  ckuus4.c, 14 Jul 94.

Made REMOTE SET WINDOW also set the local window size.  ckuus3.c, 14 Jul 94.

Got access to an Alpha AXP VMS 6.1 system with Wollongong TCP/IP, courtesy of
the Mount Sinai School of Medicine of the City University of New York, with
special thanks to Ragu Nagalingam.  Built Kermit OK, but the TELNET command
doesn't work.  Turns out to be because of some kind of DEC C prefixing.  Larry
Henry at Wollongong pointed me at the Wollongong makefile sample showing how
to get around this, but when I use it, some of the modules (like ckvfio.c)
won't compile because of conflicting definitions in Wollongong and DEC header
files.  Just for laughs, I tried building CKVFIO.C with the old makefile,
which works (luckily, CKVFIO.C contains no network references), and then
building the rest with the new procedure (a temporarily hacked-up .COM file),
and then linking them together.  It worked.  Will have to sort all this out
later.

This is Beta.10.

New XSEND.CMD Rexx procedure from Jeff Altman, for sending directory trees
from OS/2 C-Kermit, similar to the XSEND.EXE program for DOS, except there
is no intermediate command file.  CKOXSE.CMD (= XSEND.CMD on the diskette).
14 Jul 94.

Bob Babcock reported: "If I want to send file Bin/foo, and I type:

   send B<tab>f

then realize that the file name completion has not generated a path
separator, and try to backspace to correct the problem, I get a message that
file Bin is not readable.  Somehow it doesn't seem right for Kermit to
complain that I've entered something invalid in response to my attempt to
backspace to fix what I've typed."  Fixed in ckucmd.c 5A(061), 15 Jul 94.
Now if you activate filename completion on a directory name (except in the VMS
version, where path specifications have more complicated syntax), Kermit will
complete the name of the directory, then supply the path separator, and then
beep to let you know that the file specification is not complete.  CK_TMPDIR
must be defined, because we need the isdir() function for this.

\m(foo) is supposed to be a "long variable name", and should act like any
other variable, such as \%a.  However, it turns out that it never did, and
nobody ever noticed.  The difference that \m(foo) returned the definition of
the "macro" foo, literally, without bothering to evaluate it any further.  So:

  def \%a \v(date)
  echo \%a
  15 Jul 94

but:

  def foo \v(date)
  echo \m(foo)
  \v(date)

In other words, \m(foo) was the same as \fdefinition(foo).  Now \m(foo)
returns the fully evaluated definition of foo, but \fdef(foo) still returns
its "bare" definition, as before, and as it should.  I hope nobody depended on
the old erroneous behavior; if so, they need only change \m to \fdef wherever
it matters.  The new behavior is compatible with MS-DOS Kermit.  ckuus4.c,
15 Jul 94.

Added CHECK REDIRECT.  ckuusr.c 5A(142), 15 Jul 94.

New command file, ckuszrz.ini, for UNIX, for defining macros to run sz, rz,
sb, rb, sx, rx as external protocols.  Depends on the \m(foo) change and on
CHECK REDIRECT.  15 Jul 94.

Never mind.  Backed off on \m(foo) change, and reworked ckurzsz.ini
accordingly.  The \m(foo) change had disastrous consequences when "foo"
was defined to be an OS/2 file specification that included \ as the path
separator.  This totally broke almost everything in CKERMIT.INI.  Live and
learn (again).  15 Jul 94.

Roger J Allen <rja@sispro.sis.rpslmc.edu> noticed that TELNET BREAK wasn't
working any more on DYNIX/ptx, since some time after Alpha.02.  Turns out
it was broken in a lot more places than that -- everywhere but OS/2.  Fixed
in ckcnet.c 5A(034) 15 Jul 94.

This is Beta.11.

Corrected a typo in the sco3v4 makefile entry noticed by Lawrence Kirby.
20 Jul 94.

From Jeff Altman, a fix to the OS/2 version, which could crash if you:

  SET NETWORK NETBIOS BLAH
  SET HOST *

twice in a row, if you did not have TCP/IP installed on your system.
ckonet.c 5A(025) 21 Jul 94.
  
Made an executable for VAX/VMS 5.5-2 / Wollongong Pathway 1.1 thanks to access
provided by the Mt. Sanai School of Medicine in New York City.

This is Beta.12.

Fixes from Jeff Altman for OS/2 C-Kermit:  "(1) SET NETWORK NETBIOS now
defaults to the myhost[] string instead of 'kermit' for the local NetBios
name.  ckuus3.c.  (2) Refixed yesterday's tcp_avail fixes.  The previous
fixes probably broke DECNet.  I also fixed an extremely rare bug which would
occur if a file transfer was broken prematurely by the Kermit server while
using DecNet, Named Pipes, or NetBios as the transfer media.  Since these
media use a local buffer, a netflui() call must flush the local buffer as well
as the network.  Otherwise, kermit would get very confused.  ckonet.c."

Also, I changed the SET NETWORK command to fail on OS/2 if it is given for
any type of network that is not loaded.  And I changed the default network
type in OS/2 to be the first one on the following list which actually is
loaded:  TCP/IP, DECnet, NETBIOS, Named Pipe.  I also fixed the SHOW NETWORK
command to fit on one screen again by omitting details of networks which are
not loaded or active.  ckonbi.c, ckonet.c, ckuus4.c.  22 Jul 94.

Changed OS/2 SET NETWORK to hide the network names of uninstalled networks so
they won't show up in the SET NET ? listing, and changed the SET NET default
string from a hardwired "tcp/ip" to the name of the highest installed network
from the list above.  ckuus3.c, 22 Jul 94.

Fixed OS/2 C-Kermit server's response to REMOTE HELP to contain CRLFs rather
than only LFs.  ckcmai.c, 22 Jul 94.

This is Beta.13, 22 Jul 94.

Changed REMOTE SET FILE TYPE { TEXT, BINARY } to also allow LABELED.
VMS and OS/2 only.  ckuus[37].c, 23 Jul 94.

Added \v(sysid) variable to return the Kermit code for the system ID
(see pp.275-278 of the Kermit book), e.g. U1 for UNIX, UO for OS/2, etc.
ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, 23 Jul 94.

Added \v(space) variable -- for OS/2 only for now.
ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, 23 Jul 94.

Added client and server end of REMOTE PWD.  This is a new Generic server
command, "A".  ckuusr.h, ckuus7.c, ckuusr.c 5A(143), ckcpro.w 5A(065),
23 Jul 94.

Designed and implemented REMOTE QUERY and REMOTE ASSIGN, to let a Kermit
client inquire about and set the values of a Kermit server's variables.  The
design is system independent, allowing separate querying of "kermit" read-only
variables (like C-K's and MSK's \v(...) items), "system" read-only variables
(like environment variables in UNIX or DOS, or logical names in VMS), and
"global" variables (for want of a better term), which can be queried or set.
When C-Kermit is the client, results of queries (up to 1K in length) go into
the new \v(query) variable, which refers to the query response buffer, which
is 1K in length.  Anything after 1K is discarded.

Added QUERY and ASSIGN to ENABLE / DISABLE server-feature list.
ckuusr.h, ckuus6.c, ckcpro.w 5A(066) 24 Jul 94.

Added text about REMOTE QUERY and ASSIGN to server help text.
ckcmai.c, 24 Jul 94.

Added help text for REMOTE { QUERY, ASSIGN } to ckuus2.c.  24 Jul 94.

Changed REMOTE QUERY to display as well as store.  All the other REMOTE
commands display whatever comes back, so REMOTE QUERY should too.  ckcfns.c,
24 Jul 94.

Noticed that in OS/2 version, the DIRECTORY command, when given a wildcard
filespec which matched no files or exactly one file, would give a parse error.
rather than reporting "file not found" or listing the single matching file.
Fixed in ckuus6.c, and ckucmd.c 5A(062), 24 Jul 94.

Discovered that SET BUFFERS never worked in 16-bit C-Kermit implementations
where malloc() requires an integer argument, if given numbers that were too
big for the wordsize.  The 16-bit OS/2 version, for example, would just hang.
Fixed inibufs() to use unsigned ints and to catch and recover from integer
overflow, and fixed the SET BUFFERS parser also to catch integer overflow and
give an informative message.  ckcfn3.c, ckcfns.c 5A(115), 24 Jul 94.

This is Beta.14.

Cast away a bunch of complaints about (CHAR *) vs (char *) mismatches from
ckcpro.w.  26 Jul 94.

Fixed a bug in the rejection of files on the basis of size, noticed by Jeff
Altman.  ckcfn3.c, ckcfns.c 5A(116) 26 Jul 94.

Changed #ifdef COMMENT to #ifdef CK_LINGER around the block of TCP/IP
code that William Bader sent in for netopen().  This turns off the socket
"linger" parameter, which makes a close() block until all data is sent, but
which can result (he says) in Kermit hanging when telnet'ing to a flaky server
or to a modem server when the modem is in use.  Also included is some code
to increase socket buffer sizes, now selected by CK_SOCKBUF.  Both of these
symbols are undefined by default.  On SunOS 4.1.3, enabling CK_LINGER revealed
that the linger parameter was already off, so it had no effect.  Enabling 
CK_SOCKBUF increased the socket buffers from 24576 to 32768, but no
improvement in performance was noted.  ckcnet.c 5A(035), 30 Jul 94.

From Steve Walton: Commodore Amiga support for the DIAL and SCRIPT commands.
ckudia.c 5A(059), ckuscr.c 5A(020), 30 Jul 94.

Don't call prescan() if NOICP is defined.  ckcmai.c 5A(190), 30 Jul 94.
From Michael T Pins <amigapd@icaen.uiowa.edu>.

A lot of recoding in the system-independent modules to allow F and G packets
(as well as ACKs) to be long packets of any length at all, up to the maximum
negotiated length.  Elimination of various extraneous limited-length static
buffers and arcane code regarding encstr() -- encstr() now encodes directly
into the packet data buffer.  I don't remember what the problem was before
that prevented this from working, but I must have fixed it since then.  These
changes allow filenames, server commands, and ACK data fields up to the
maximum negotiated packet length, and thus allow short-form responses to
server commands to be made via long ACK packets.  C-Kermit server tested
against both C-Kermit and MS-DOS Kermit client successfully.  ckcpro.w
5A(067), ckcfns.c 5A(117), ckcfn2.c, ckuusx.c, etc etc, 30 Jul 94.

Changed REMOTE QUERY GLOBAL to REMOTE QUERY USER -- just the name, not the
semantics... GLOBAL is too computery.  ckuus7.c.  30 Jul 94.

Ever since the UNIX APC code went into ckucon.c on July 9th, Eduard Vopicka in
Prague <Eduard.Vopicka@vse.cz> has been finding and closing little race
conditions in the interprocess communication between the two CONNECT forks.
First, he found that the msleep(250) was not necessarily enough, so what was
needed was a portable equivalent of semaphores.  To make a 3-week-long story
short, we now have the two CONNECT forks interrupting each other in *both*
directions, rather than just one, and using pipes in both directions to ensure
that needed actions have completed.  Also, we're back to using one signal
rather than two, and that signal can be defined at compile time.  It turns out
that SIGUSR1 is not safe on all systems -- for example, it is said to do take
the place of SIGURG in SCO versions, to signal OOB data on a TCP socket.  And
of course, we learned earlier that SIGUSR2 is dangerous elsewhere, like in
UnixWare.  So in ckucon.c we now use CK_FORK_SIG, which can be defined at
compile time to be any signal you want.  Because of the new synchronization
between the forks, many msleeps and sleeps could be removed, resulting in
noticeably snappier performance.  Eduard also discovered that under certain
conditions -- apparently only involving APCs -- the CONNECT module can be
entered with an alarm() active, which eventually goes off causing a longjmp to
a long-gone place and thus a core dump.  The cause was not found, but adding a
call to ttimoff() in the CONNECT module fixes the problem.  I took Ed's work
pretty much as-is, but had to fix assorted portability problems, mainly with
preprocessor constructions & identifier names, and also fixed the problem with
the disappearing "Back at..." message after an APC had been executed.
ckucon.c 5A(068), ckutio.c 5A(142), 30 Jul 94.

Tested new UNIX CONNECT module on SunOS 4.1.3, NeXTSTEP 3.1, UnixWare 1.1.1,
Solaris 2.3 (with both GNU cc and SUNPro CC), Linux 0.9.14, HP-UX 9.03.
It seems to function perfectly everywhere.

Also from Eduard: an ASCII-graphic percent-done thermometer for the fullscreen
file transfer display.  Included only if you define CK_PCT_BAR, which is not
defined by default.  ckuusr.c 5A(144), ckuusx.c, 30 Jul 94.

Changed HELP module to check terminal rows not only in HELP command, but
also in INTRO and anything else that calls hmsga().  ckuus2.c, 31 Jul 94.

Added #define NOJC to ckoker.h, because SUSPEND is not supported in OS/2 C-K.
31 Jul 94.

Added \v(startup) (startup device:directory) to OS/2 version.  ckuusr.h,
ckuus4.c, 31 Jul 94.

More changes to OS/2 NETBIOS support from Jeff Altman, primarily that NETBIOS
can never be the default network type because the user has to choose a session
name.  ckonet.c 5A(027), 31 Jul 94.

OS/2 space-checking routine fixed by Jeff A to account for the space that will
be vacated by an existing file that will be removed because of the file
collision action.  ckufio.c 5A(092), 31 Jul 94.

Removed "ioctl(ttyfd,TCSAFLUSH,&n);" from the BSD44 section of UNIX ttflui().
TCSAFLUSH is not a valid argument for ioctl().  This call was making console
messages ("ser0: ioctl(,2,,)") pop up on the system console of (at least)
NetBSD/Mac68k systems.  Reported by Ken Nakata <kxn3796@hertz.njit.edu>.
ckutio.c 5A(143), 31 Jul 94.

I discovered that when C-Kermit has a connection to a Kermit server upon
which C-Kermit's own packets are echoed back at it, C-Kermit's "echo
cancellation" technique fails under certain circumstances, and one of them
leads to an infinite loop.  Most of this has to do with the overloading of
packet 0...  Anyway the solution was to have the protocol state machine ignore
E packets and Y packets when in server command wait state.  Previously,
C-Kermit would answer an E packet received in this state with another E
packet, which not only was wrong, but results in an infinite exchange of
E-packets.  And when the C-Kermit server replies to a G command with a
short-form response (i.e. in the data field of an ACK) and the ACK is echoed
back, C-K would not detect it as an echo.  So ACKs received during server
command wait are also now ignored.  ckcpro.w 5A(068), 31 Jul 94.

In the course of this investigation it was discovered that the mysterious
messages like:

  @-|3$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$5$0___E

that we sometimes see were the result of an Init string (in the data field of
an ACK to an I packet) being misinterpreted as encoded data, which happens
when the client's G packet is clobbered: the server times out and retransmits
its previous ACK to the client's I packet, which contains the Init string, but
the client thinks it is a short-form reply to the G packet "decodes" it,
producing results like the above.  There is no way for the client to tell the
difference because the two Y packets have the same sequence number (0):

Nelson Beebe reported that if you used C-Kermit under Solaris 2.3 in local
mode to transfer a file with its FILE DISPLAY set to FULLSCREEN, then upon
return to the prompt, keystrokes would no longer echo.  I fixed this by
adding -DCK_NEWTERM to the Solaris makefile entries.  31 Jul 94.

This is Beta.15, 31 Jul 94.

Corrected a typo in the incoming-file-size-checking code, from Jeff Altman.
ckufio.c 5A(093) 1 Aug 94.

Minor correction to an error-handling section in UNIX CONNECT module from
Eduard Vopicka.  Also, reshuffling of some of the declarations to allow
non-DYNAMIC compilations to work right.  ckucon.c 5A(069), 1 Aug 94.

Added -DDYNAMIC -DCK_CURSES + "LIBS= -lcurses -ltermcap" to Tandy 16/1600
makefile entry, from Jay Rouman <jsr@dexter.mi.org>.  Makefile, 2 Aug 94.

Added Transfer Rate (CPS) to the fullscreen file transfer display, and
made a couple other minor changes to it.  ckuusx.c, 2 Aug 94.

Added \v(charset), which in the general case is the current file character
set, and in OS/2 is the current codepage (which is usually also the current
file set).  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, 3 Aug 94.

A correction to ckcmai.c from Mike Long <Mike.Long@Analog.com> to prevent
hlptxt from coming up undefined when built with -DNOSERVER, and correction
to some wording in SHOW FEATURES in ckuus5.c.  3 Aug 94.

Added the file transfer thermometer as a runtime selection in all CK_CURSES
versions: SET FILE DISPLAY FULL { THERMOMETER, NO-THERMOMETER }.  No
thermometer is the default except in OS/2, which has a nice-looking one.
ckuusr.h, ckuus7.c, ckuusx.c.  3 Aug 94.

Core dumps reported on NetBSD.  In tracking this down with gdb, I discovered
that SIGQUIT was always armed in SVORPOSIX versions, even when FIONREAD,
CK_POLL, SELECT, or RDCHK were available, a mistake which makes it impossible
to escape back to the prompt under gdb, because gdb takes over SIGQUIT.
So now esctrp() and all references to it in ckutio.c are enabled only if
SVORPOSIX is defined *and* FIONREAD, SELECT, RDCHK, and CK_POLL are *all*
undefinded.  ckutio.c 5A(144), 4 Aug 94.

NetBSD saga: Crash is reproducible.  It happens every time we return to the
prompt after showing a curses display.  It's because something overwrites the
cmprom pointer.  When transferring files without using a curses display, it
never crashes.  So this narrows it down to the code in ckuusx.c that handles
the curses display, or else the curses library itself.  Trying to debug this
with gdb, placing a watchpoint on cmprom takes hours and hours...  (Hours and
hours later...)  It turns out the problem was caused by a bcopy() within
getwd() writing over random memory.  Cured by using getcwd() instead.  (The
real cause, pointed out by Mike Long, is that MAXPATHLEN was not appropriately
defined, because ckufio.c was not #including <sys/param.h> -- who knew.
ckufio.c 5A(094) 4 Aug 94.

However, there must have been some reason I was using getwd() in 4.4BSD to
begin with, but I can't find it in my notes.  Vangogh at Berkeley is down now,
but that's where I would have done it.  Checking on BSDI, it seems OK there,
no core dumps, etc, but something else is wrong: the curses display only works
once.  The second time, many of the fields are stuck against the left and
right margins.  Session logs show that curses is sending different stuff the
second time around -- the escape sequences and graphic characters are the
same, but the tabs are all messed up -- too many or too few in many cases.
But this does not happen on NetBSD.

Fixes from Jeff Altman for the situation in which rapid-fire APCs from the
host could hang OS/2 C-Kermit.  ckocon.c 5A(152), ckomou.c 5A(002), 5 Aug 94.

Changes to OS/2 NETBIOS support to allow multiple virtual adapters, e.g. when
IBM and Novell NETBIOS to coexist on the same machine, from Jeff Altman.
ckuus[4y].c.  5 Aug 94.

Made 4.4BSD-based versions search <sys/param.h> to get MAXPATHLEN, and
put a little more bullet-proofing, debugging, and comments in this area.
ckufio.c 5A(095), 5 Aug 94.

Changes to SET PORT NETBIOS command to allow switching from a NETBIOS
connection to (say) a TCP/IP connection, and then back to the same NETBIOS
connection without getting an error.  ckuus3.c, 5 Aug 94.

Adjustments to previous edit by Jeff Altman.  ckuus3.c, 6 Aug 94.

QNX work, QNX 4.2.1, Watcom C16 9.5, 6 Aug 94:
 . Basic 32-bit version, OK: 366259.
 . Added KANJI, TCPSOCKET, OK: 400459.
 . Job Control doesn't work: ^Z has no effect, SUSPEND hangs (sh, ksh),
   leaves zombies behind after disconnecting.
 . ANSIC OK, Optimize -O OK: 433669.
 . CK_NAWS, CK_TMPDIR, OK.
 . CK_REDIR <sys/wait.h>: 435179.  Works too.
 . CK_CURSES OK: 396363 (curses but no TCP)
 . curses-related core dump - happens 2nd time curses is invoked.
   Fixed by calling initscr() every time, but 2nd & subsequent displays
   are messed up, like on BSDI.  Several hours spent fooling with this
   one, to no avail.
 . CK_WREFRESH added, works OK, but using stdscr instead of curscr
   because QNX curses doesn't have curscr.
 . Added 57600, 76800, 115200 bps.  No way of testing them.
 . ckhost() didn't work; it was calling uname(), changed to gethostname().
 . Input-buffer-peeking methods available are FIONREAD and select().
   FIONREAD works, but needed <sys/ioctl.h> included, works ok.
 . Including <sys/ioctl.h> also gives us modem signals (TIOCMGET, etc).
 . For msleep, added -DSELECT for select(), for which <sys/select.h> needed
   including.
 . "INPUT n string" doesn't work in remote mode, i.e. coninc(x) where x > 0
   (timed console read) does not work.  Ditto for local mode and ttinc(x).
   But ttinl(timo..) does work.  It's as if a single-character read() can't
   be interrupted, but a multiple-character read can be.  Thus, an INPUT that
   fails will hang forever.

Outstanding problems:

 . Ctrl-C trap doesn't work, I can't see why.  SIGINT is armed in in conint(),
   but it is never caught.  It is probably something to do with the c_cc[]
   array that is set up in concb() in ckutio.c.  Anyway, in command mode,
   C-Kermit reads Ctrl-C just like any other character.
 . Job control doesn't work.  Code compiles and links ok, but SIGTSTP key
   is ignored and SUSPEND command makes the program hang, no matter which
   shell is used.
 . Reactivating the curses display after first leaving it doesn't work right.
 . ttinc(n) and coninc(n) single-character read()s never get interrupted by
   alarm()/signal(), so INPUT can hang.
 . Hardware flow control needs to be added, I don't see how to do it.
   termios.h has bits called TT*HW, but they are for tcflow(), which is used
   for flow control actions, not flow-control mode selection, so I don't see
   how to do it.  There is no termios.h, and there is no CRTSCTS symbol
   defined anywhere, nor CTSFLOW or RTSFLO, nor RTSXOFF, etc etc.
 . A 16-bit version still needs to be built.
 . SET SPEED, especially high speeds, needs testing.
 . Does QNX use UUCP lockfiles?  If so, which kind?  /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..???
 . Dialout and serial comms in general needs testing.

Discovered why Ctrl-C trap didn't work in QNX.  concb() (the routine that
sets the console terminal modes for command parsing) did not set the ISIG
flag in c_lflag unless job control was enabled.  Very silly -- it should
always be set, otherwise we can't catch SIGINT.  This partially fixes the
problem.  Now the first Ctrl-C is caught but subsequent ones are ignored;
they don't even show up as data characters any more.  And yet the signal is
definitely being rearmed, as revealed in the debug.log.

Changed UNIX C-Kermit to check the handling of SIGTSTP immediately upon
startup, and if it is SIG_IGNored, then not to catch SIGTSTP signals and
suspend itself, since the shell above won't know what to do with a suspended
Kermit, and will just hang.  This doesn't help QNX though.
ckutio.c 5A(145), 6 Aug 94.

On the QNX system I was using, it turns out that I can't get *any* process to
suspend, so it's not just Kermit -- no matter what shell I use (sh, csh, ksh).
stty -a says that ^Z is the suspend character, and so does Kermit's debug log.
(Later, I learned that QNX does not support job control, and so added -DNOJC
to the compilation).

At the suggestion of James Lummel <jlummel@caprica.com>, changed jmp_buf,
setjmp, and longjmp to sigjmp_buf, sigsetjmp, and siglongjmp in the QNX
version, because QNX uses POSIX signal-handling, namely that whenever a signal
is generated, it is masked off, and the signal handler must unmask it.  This
is done by sigjmp_buf, sigsetjmp, and siglongjmp.  This is why SIGINT would be
caught only once.  A new symbol governs this: CK_POSIX_SIG, which is currently
defined (in ckcdeb.h) only for QNX.  ckcmai.c, ckcnet.c 5A(036), ckucon.c
5A(071), ckudia.c 5A(060), ckuscr.c 5A(022), ckutio.c 5A(146), ckuusx.c,
ckuusr.c 5A(145), 7 Aug 94.  Testing on QNX shows that this change clears up
the problems with Ctrl-C and with timeouts not working (but it makes me wonder
why C-Kermit works without these changes on all the other POSIX-based UNIX
implementations -- I guess they are not so strictly POSIX after all), so now
we need:

 . The restarting-curses problem fixed.
 . UUCP lockfile conventions worked out.
 . setuid/setgid operation checked out.
 . DIAL command checked out.
 . Serial communications checked out.
 . Hardware flow control added.
 . A 16-bit version produced.

I built Kermit on Linux 0.99.14 with CK_POSIX_SIG and it works fine, so I
added this to the makefile, plus some warning comments about how to back off.
Linked the Linux version with libncurses rather than libcurses, and the
second-invocation-of-curses problem went away.  Added this to the makefile
too.  makefile, 7 Aug 94.

Fixed VMS RUN and DIRECTORY commands to return success/failure status
according to return codes from zshcmd(), based on whether LIB$SPAWN returns
SS$_NORMAL (it always does).  Larry Henry of TWG just sent in code to get
the actual return code from the command, but I haven't quite figured out how
to use it -- it almost works...  ckuus6.c, ckvfio.c 5A(112), 7 Aug 94.

Beta.16.

Aug 8... QNX again.  Disabled job control because QNX does not yet implement
it.  Worked on 16-bit version with much assistance from Dan Hildebrand of QNX
Software Systems Inc in Kanata, ON <danh@qnx.com>.  Removed various features:
speeds higher than 38400 because of 16-bitness; ioctl() can't be used because
it is not in the 16-bit libs.  Aside from that, everything is there: TCP/IP,
curses, all character sets, etc.  Makefile, ckuusx.c, ckutio.c, 8 Aug 94.

Tried adding hardware flow control to QNX version based on info from danh:
IEXTEN must be set in c_lflag, and then IHFLOW|OHFLOW are set in c_cflag.
It compiles and runs OK, but who knows if it works.  ckutio.c 5A(147),
8 Aug 94.

Discovered that bad things could happen if a file arrived whose name was
longer than C-Kermit's maximum filename length, e.g. the file would not be
transferred because C-Kermit failed to open the output file.  zrtol() changed
to cut the name off at the maximum length.  ckufio.c 5A(096) 8 Aug 94.

The #ifdefs around the POSIX signal-handling changes were inconsistent in
ckuusx.c, noticed by Eduard Vopicka, and this would result in a memory leak
that could cause a core dump.  Fixed (#ifdef QNX => #ifdef CK_POSIX_SIG) in
ckuusx.c, ckuusr.c 5A(146), 9 Aug 94.

Added serial high speeds back into the 16-bit QNX version.  This required an
internal change to ttsspd() and ttgspd(), which should be safe, namely 
declaring the internal speed variable to be of type speed_t rather than int
if it is a POSIX compilation, since this type is required by POSIX.1 for
cfsetispeed(), etc.  Tested OK on QNX, BSDI, and Linux.  Also, changed
ttgwsiz() to work on 16-bit QNX as well as 32-bit QNX.  ckcdeb.h, ckutio.c
5A(148) 9 Aug 94.

Got access to an SGI IRIX 5.2 system, built today's C-K with no problems.
Looked thru header files, found no evidence of hardware flow control or serial
speeds > 19200.  9 Aug 94.

This is Beta.17

Discovered the QNX version omitted SET SPEED 57600 due to a typo.
ckcdeb.h 10 Aug 94.

Added QNX-specific modem-signal code to ttmget() in ckutio.c 5A(149),
10 Aug 94.

Verified that serial comms work ok on QNX: SET LINE, DIAL, CONNECT, file
transfer, etc.  RTS/CTS seems to work, but I can't tell for sure.

From Jeff Altman: fullscreen file transfer display now updates the
Estimated Time Remaining no more than once per second.  ckuusx.c, 10 Aug 94.

Decided to use the thermometer in the curses display by default after all.
It kind of grew on me.  ckuus7.c, 10 Aug 94.

Tried building on Solaris 2.3 with SunPro CC.  It compiles fine but doesn't
link because ckuus5.o is only about 1/10 of its normal size.  Building it by
hand, however, via cc -E "CFLAGS=(same ones)..." > foo.c, then cc -c foo.c
produces a normal object file (!?), which can then be linked with the others,
producing a normal executable.  Better try this on some other machine...
(Later, it turns out that Sun cc 2.0.1 does this -- with patches applied,
not sure which ones, the problem goes away.)

Changed format of ASCII thermometer slightly, at Eduard Vopicka's suggestion,
and used new, simplified, unified code for OS/2 and all others, from Ed.
ckuusx.c, 11 Aug 94.

Added -DNOSETBUF to QNX makefile entries.  11 Aug 94.

Made VMS conoll() return a proper return code.  Until now, it always returned
a success indication, even if it failed, which could wreak havoc when the
user's job become disconnected in the middle of a TRANSMIT command.  CKVTIO.C
5A(073), 11 Aug 94.  Also, changed TRANSMIT command to check conoll's return
code.

From Jeff Altman, a fix to ckcpro.w that allows labeled-mode transfers to
work when a GET command is given.  11 Aug 94.

Added debugging statements to zopeno() and zclose() in ckmfio.c in an attempt
to track down the cause for Mac Kermit failures on the newer Macs.  12 Aug 94.

Added some bulletproofing to the console routines in the VMS version to better
catch when the job becomes disconnected from its console terminal.  12 Aug 94.

Added percent efficiency to fullscreen file transfer display summary. ckuusx.c,
13 Aug 94.

Vincent Fatica reported that the SET SPEED command in the Linux version was
broken.  After three hours of debugging, it finally hit me: s (the speed) is
now declared of type speed_t in POSIX implementations, and in Linux speed_t is
typedef unsigned int (POSIX.1 says that speed_t "shall" be unsigned, but in
other systems I looked at it, was simply "long").  Today's lesson: comparisons
of unsigned variables with negative constants don't produce the desired
results -- e.g. don't use -1 as a value for the speed variable, to mean the
speed is unknown.  It took quite a while to recover from the fallout -- ttvt()
and ttpkt() needed some head-bashing, etc.  Made and tested many new binaries
on Linux, SunOS, Solaris, Unixware, IRIX, QNX, HP-UX, etc etc.  ckutio.c
5A(150), 13 Aug 94.

Discovered that REDIRECT works OK in QNX on serial connections, but not on
TCP/IP connections.

Fixed "Network type" in fullscreen file transfer display.  ckuusx.c, 13 Aug 94.

Max Evarts <evarts@columbia.edu> reported the following scenario: MS-DOS
Kermit is a TCP/IP Kermit server ("set port tcp *"), C-Kermit is the client.
MS-DOS Kermit side goes away (e.g. user Ctrl-C's and hangs up).  The next
packet-related command given to C-Kermit makes the C-Kermit process
immediately and silently disappear.  This happens under at least SunOS,
NeXTSTEP, and Unixware.  It occurs when ttol() is called to send a packet to
the server.  ttol() calls upon write(), and write(), rather than returning an
error, kills the entire process.  To avoid this situation, I devised a cunning
plan: ttol(), before issuing a write() on a TCP/IP connection, checks to see
if the connection is still there by issuing a read() for zero bytes.  On SunOS
the read always succeeds if the connection is active, and fails with
ECONNRESET if the connection has been dropped.  This allows us to print an
informative error message, close down our end of the connection, and
gracefully return a failure code rather than vanishing without a trace.
However, a quick check of other OS's shows that this technique is not a bit
portable.  It's OK in NeXTSTEP, but not in Unixware.  So it will be used only
if CK_READ0 is defined, and presently it is defined only for SUNOS41 and NEXT.
ckcnet.h, ckutio.c 5A(151), 14 Aug 94.

This also required some adjustments to ckcpro.w, ckcfn*.c, etc, to ensure that
failure return codes are propogated up the call stack.  14 Aug 94.

Added a new command, FORWARD.  It is exactly like GOTO except it searches for
the given label forward from the current position in the macro or TAKE file,
rather than rewinding to the beginning first.  This command is purely for
performance -- executing long scripts from diskettes, for example, can be
painfully slow if every GOTO must rewind the command file.  (It might have
been better to fix GOTO to first search forward, then rewind, then search up
to where the first search started, but that would (a) need a lot of recoding,
and (b) break a lot of existing scripts.)  This is not an example of a quality
control structure, and its use is not recommended except where script
performance is critical.  ckuusr.h, ckuus6.c, ckuusr.c 5A(147), 14 Aug 94.

Added transaction log entries for incoming file refusal.  Also, when receiving
files, don't send an error packet if there is an error opening the output file
-- instead, just refuse the file.  That way, an error on one file does not
prevent subsequent files from coming.  Added a statistic for files that were
discarded/rejected/interrupted, so STATISTICS and the transaction log now show
the number of files that were actually successfully transferred.
ckcfns.c 5A(118), ckcfn2.c, ckcfn3.c, ckuus4.c, 15 Aug 94.

Fixed Mac Kermit not to crash when downloading files under System 7.1.x by
removing the call to PBFlushFile() from ckmfio.c.  And fixed the Mac Kermit
READ command not to crash.  Tested on Mac IIx with System 6.0.3, Mac LC with
System 7.0, Centris 660 AV with System 7.1, and a Power Mac 7100/66 with
System 7.1.2 (the latter two being platforms where downloads would crash
Kermit or the Mac prior to today), including downloads of 1MB-long files.
ckmfio.c 5A(084), 16 Aug 94.

Changed Mac Kermit's version number from 0.99(190) to 0.991(190) so people can
tell the difference between the one that works and previous ones.  Fixed LOG
SESSION, LOG TRANSACTIONS, LOG PACKETS, which never worked before.  In the
case of LOG SESSION, this required consolidation of the Session Log menu
selection and the LOG SESSION command, which used totally different
mechanisms.  Changed text files to be TeachText ('ttxt') applications, rather
than MacWrite ('MACA').  Fixed format of log and other text files to be like
regular Mac text files.  Removed Mac-specific tlog() and had Mac Kermit use
the regular one, which works fine.  Fixed file transfer display not to lie
about "Sending" and "Receiving".  Fixed Mac-specific modules not to mess with
file type setting behind the back of the protocol modules so downloads would
take the right data type from the attribute packet.  Added SET FILE TYPE
MACBINARY to command parser.  Updated the ckmker.bwr file.  ckcfn3.c,
ckcker.h, ckmfio.c, ckmini.c, ckmsfp.c, ckmusr.c, ckmutl.c, ckuus4.c,
ckuus7.c, ckuusx.c, 17 Aug 94.

Made Mac Kermit's file transfer display screen correctly show the transfer
mode of incoming files.  Made the SET FILE TYPE command immediately affect the
internal file transfer mode of the Mac modules, so the Settings..File Defaults
dialog shows the right modes, no matter how they were set.  It works for
MacBinary too.  ckmscr.c, ckmfio.c, ckmsfp.c, 18 Aug 94.

Fixed Mac zgtdir() routine to return the actual working directory -- the full
pathname, not just the current folder name, rather than the disk name, with
help from Rick Watson <rick@akbar.cc.utexas.edu>.  Previously, it returned
the name of the current disk.   Zhome() was corrected to return the name of
the boot disk.  ckmfio.c, 18 Aug 94.

Discovered why we get "Writing to console not allowed" alert boxes all the
time: they are caused by perror().  Nobody ever bothered to for perror what
had been done for printf().  So I did it.  ckcdeb.h, ckmptp.h,
ckmtio.c 5A(082), 18 Aug 94.

Changed the CD command for Mac Kermit to allow spaces in the directory name,
and to use the top-level directory of the boot disk as its default place to
CD to.  ckuus5.c, 18 Aug 94.

Added the current directory to Mac Kermit's file transfer display.
ckmscr.c, 18 Aug 94.

A couple more fixes to Mac Kermit's file transfer display, so that file
transfer commands issued at the Mac-Kermit> prompt would be reflected
correctly (e.g. it would not say "Receiving" if it was sending).  ckuusr.c
5A(148), 19 Aug 94.

Added a DIRECTORY command to Mac Kermit.  It shows regular files and their
sizes, but does not show directory files.  ckuusr.c, ckuus6.c, 19 Aug 94.

Removed SET FILE COLLISION DISCARD from Mac Kermit because it crashes the
program.  Removed { APPEND, NEW } options from Mac Kermit LOG command because
append operations don't work.  ckuus4.c, ckuus7.c, 19 Aug 94.

Added a new command-parsing function, cmtxtnq(), which is just like cmtxt()
except it treats question mark and backslash like ordinary text characters.
ckucmd.c 5A(063), 19 Aug 94.  (Later removed)

Changed the ASK and ASKQ commands to use cmtxtnq() rather than cmtxt(),
so script-driven interactive dialogs can be carried on with unsuspecting
users without scaring them if they type a question mark.  This is also a good
idea for situations like "ask \%x \27Z", in which the terminal might send back
a string containing question marks, like ESC [ ? 1 c, which would otherwise
cause an infinite round of "getty babble".  It's also handy for prompting
users for DOS-like filenames, such as C:\TEMP\OOFA.TXT, which could not
otherwise be entered except by making the users double each backslash.  See
ckcker.upd for more about this.  ckuus6.c, 19 Aug 94.

Added CHECK FORWARD to allow .INI & other files to select GOTO or FORWARD.
ckuusr.c 5A(149), 20 Aug 94.

Jeff Altman had changed CKERMIT.INI to use FORWARD instead of GOTO, but this
was a rather drastic change that would prevent it from working at all with
last week's or earlier Kermit versions, so the new CKERMIT.INI does a CHECK
FORWARD first to see if this is OK.  20 Aug 94.

VMS 6.0 (or 6.1) changed its "terminal inquire" feature.  Old versions of VMS
sent ESC Z first, then ESC [ c if the ESC Z response timed out.  The new
version reverses this, and then also sends a "resize" sequence.  I needed to
change the VMSLOGIN macro to account for both methods, but found it was
virtually impossible to put an MINPUT command into a macro because of the
comma that is used to separate the MINPUT arguments.  Luckily, some time ago
James Sturdevant had sent in code to let space, rather than comma, be the
separator, with {...} used for grouping items that have imbedded spaces.  This
also required a change at the deepest level of the command parser (the
gtword() function), which is something we always wanted -- the ability to
group words where they could not be grouped before.  E.g. now we can do:

  if equal \%a {This is a bunch of words} echo It's equal.

Previously, this would break on the space after "This" and give a parse error.
The new code was tested with all the various command-testing suites
(ckermit.ini, ckermod.ini, cketest.ini, ckedemo.ini, etc) and no ill effects
were noted.  ckucmd.c 5A(064), ckuusr.c 5A(149), 20 Aug 94.

More about this from James's notes:

I did "white box" testing, looking for places in the code where cmfld was
called and then testing them.  The modules are

    ckuusr  array names
            labels  (A label :{This label} is accepted
                     but GOTO won't find it)
            minput (now)
    ckuus5  macro names
             This works:Define {Space name} The name has a space
                        echo \m({Space name})
    ckuus6  variable names and file names
    ckuus7  user id and password.
            IP name/number
            TCP service name/number
    calls to cmfld or gtword in ckucmd:
            cmfld cmnum cmofi cmifi cmdir cmtxt cmkey

New VMSLOGIN macro handles old and new terminal inquiry sequences.
CKERMIT.INI, 20 Aug 94.

Added code from Jeff Altman to (a) display a weighted CPS rate in the
fullscreen file transfer display, rather than a flat average, with a weight
of 1/4 going to the most recent second, and 3/4 going to past history.  The
final CPS is still calculated the normal way -- (total file chars / secs).
And also from Jeff, code to allow the file-transfer display screen to be
refreshed in OS/2.  ckuusx.c, 20 Aug 94.

Added SET COMMAND QUOTING { ON, OFF }.  ON means normal behavior.  OFF (new)
means to treat \ and ? as ordinary text characters during input to the command
parser.  The main purpose of this is allow a script writer to confer the same
behavior on other commands as was given to ASK a couple days ago, or to let
the experienced user turn off backslash processing to make it easier to deal
with DOS or OS/2 filesnames, e.g.:

  set command quoting off
  send foo.bar c:\foo\bar\baz\oofa.txt
  get d:\files\???.?
  set command quoting on

instead of:

  send foo.bar c:\\foo\\bar\\baz\\oofa.txt
  get d:\\files\\\?\?\?.\?

Or in OS/2 itself:

  set command quoting off
  cd \
  set port \\server\modem
  directory e:\pictures\pic???.gif
  set command quoting on

rather than:

  cd \\
  set port \\\\server\\modem
  directory e:\\pictures\\pic\?\?\?.gif
  set command quoting on

Use with caution.  ckucmd.c, ckuus6.c, 20 Aug 94.

In VMS version, make congm() get terminal type, etc, to remove annoying
"Sorry, terminal type not supported" messages when running from a .COM file,
SPAWN'd, etc.  From James Sturdevant.  CKVTIO.C 5A(075), 20 Aug 94.

Added #include "ckcsym.h" to all modules that didn't already have it, and
added dependencies on it to all rules in the makefile.  From Mike Long.
20 Aug 94.

Fixed up "kermit -h" help screen to include recently added options, and to
report bad options by saying what they were.  ckuus[2y].c, 20 Aug 94.

Reorganized the ckcker.upd file.  21 Aug 94.

This is Beta.18

Removed a prototype for a static function from ckcnet.h.  Today's lesson:
never use the word "static" in a header file, and certainly not in one that is
shared by more than one module.  22 Aug 94.

Fixed the VMS C-Kermit makefile to build correctly with MultiNet on the 
Alpha, thanks to a suggestion from Steve Smail at Wollongong:

  "After I generated a link map, I realized that the link is pulling in the
  DEC C/UCX based socket routines, not those provided by PathWay.  These
  routines return the DEC C version of a file descriptor, not a VMS device
  channel; the QIO system service needs the channel, and is rejecting that
  parameter as invalid.  I suspect the same issue occurs when building KERMIT
  against TGV's product (though I have no way to test this).

  "The DEC C compiler will prepend the string DECC$ to the name of most
  "known" C library entries.  For example, references to fopen() become
  decc$fopen(), socket() to decc$socket(), etc ... at link time, DEC's entries
  are used, not those provided by PathWay in the TWGLIB.OLB object library.

  "We typically get around this issue by making use of the DEC C compiler
  /PREFIX_LIBRARY_ENTRIES qualifier to request that the compiler not prepend
  DECC$ to our socket library routines."

Tested successfully on VMS 1.5 and 6.1 on Alphas, and VMS 5.3 on a VAX.
The Alpha VMS 1.5 version runs fine on 6.1.  23 Aug 94.

Converted OS/2 C-Kermit update file from plain text to INFO (VIEW) format.
25-29 Aug 94.

Exchanged "thermometer" definitions between ckuus7.c and ckuusx.c to allow
successful linking with -DCK_CURSES and -DNOICP.  29 Aug 94.

Added SIGPIPE handling to ckudia.c, which is needed to catch the case where
a connection to a TELNET modem server is broken while dialing (previously, as
reported by Ray Moody, Kermit would just disappear when this happened).
29 Aug 94.

Minor corrections to makefile for SCO UNIX 3.2v4 & ODT 3.0.  Minor change to
ckutio.c to allow cross compilation under UNIX for Xenix.  From William Bader.
makefile, ckutio.c 5A(152), 30 Aug 94.

Ray Moody found some other places (SCRIPT, INPUT, etc etc) where remotely
broken TCP/IP connections could result in the Kermit process vanishing (in
UNIX, not sure about others).  He suggested setting SIGPIPE to SIG_IGN in
ttol() & then restoring it, but that only plugs the hole in one place.
Instead, I added signal(SIGPIPE,SIG_IGN) to sysinit(), so SIGPIPE is ignored
the whole time Kermit is running, and removed all other SIGPIPE-related code
from ckudia.c, ckutio.c, and ckucon.c, as well as the CK_READ0 business from a
couple weeks ago.  Tested successfully on SunOS by SET HOST to MS-DOS Kermit
that had been told to "set port tcp *", and then issuing HANGUP from MS-DOS
Kermit while C-Kermit is transferring files, dialing, in CONNECT mode, running
a script program, etc etc.  30 Aug 94.

TMPDIR and RESEND capabilities added to Stratus VOS Kermit by David Lane.
Changes merged into ckcdeb.h, ckuus6.c, cklfio.c 5A(003), 30 Aug 94.

Fixed server to encode response to REMOTE PWD, noticed by David Lane (because
VOS directory names include #).  ckcpro.w 5A(070), 30 Aug 94.

Changes to OS/2 install script from Jeff Altman, so it now correctly updates
the desktop icon, even if an old one was already there.  Also a minor change
to ckotio.c to recognize CKERMIT as a synonym for CKCOMMAND from REXX scripts.
30 Aug 94.

Fixed OS/2 C-Kermit to allow SET { SEND, RECEIVE } START-OF-PACKET to be
a printable character.  ckuus7.c, 30 Aug 94.

This is Beta.19, 30 Aug 94.

Fixed editing of several SET TERMINAL commands (WRAP, ANSWERBACK) -- OS/2
only.  31 Aug 94.

Cast long arguments to shocps() to int.  ckuusx.c, 31 Aug 94.

Updates to CKVKER.MMS from Mike Freeman (CMU/Tek, Mattgoat MMK support).
1 Sep 94.

From Eduard Vopicka, 1 Sep 94:

(1) Solution to previously mentioned ftime redefinition problem in
    ckufio.c: ODT30 has prototype for ftime() in header file, so always
    use it, no matter what it is. Just as mentioned in the original
    comments. Tested on both XPG4 and pre-XPG4 version of SCO 3.2v4.2.

(2) -DCK_WREFRESH can be safely added to the sco32v4net makefile entry.

(3) Hot keys (X to cancel file etc) do not work during file transfer!!!
    This is certainly serious problem, but fortunately, the fix is fairly
    easy (namely that FIONREAD is defined, but doesn't do anything and so
    needs to be undefined after #including <sys/socket.h>).

From Mike Long <mike.long@analog.com>, Analog Devices Inc, Norwood MA, USA:

  These patches modify Kermit to use the 4.4BSD seteuid() and setegid()
  functions.  You want to use sete[ug]id() on 4.4-based systems because
  setreuid() is a compatibility function that is implemented on top of them,
  and it doesn't behave exactly the same.  Also, the system I use (NetBSD)
  sends an obnoxious warning to the console if setreuid() is used.  I've been
  using these patches for the past month without any problems.
  ckutio.c, 1 Sep 94.

Added CK_POLL to MIPS makefile entries -- not only does it work, it also
eliminates core dumps in msleep() (thanks to Bob Bolio (sp?) at Santa Cruz
Metro Transit for testing this out over the phone).  makefile, 1 Sep 94.

Added a call to con_cancel() to syscleanup() in ckvtio.c in hopes of curing
problems with VMS C-Kermit leaving zombie processes behind after being
disconnected and/or interrupted.  ckvtio.c 5A(076) 2 Sep 94.

New code and makefile for OS/2 C-Kermit to support FTP Software 32-bit PC/TCP
from Jeff Altman.  ckoker.mak, ..., ckonet.c 5A(030) 2 Sep 94.

Added code to allow spaces in input and output file names (cmifi, cmofi) and
directory names (cmdir) when either expressed as \32 or when the name is
enclosed in braces.  It works in commands like CD, SEND, and RECEIVE, which
are executed by Kermit itself, but an additional level of quoting might still
be needed if the result is being passed to (say) a UNIX shell, e.g.
DIRECTORY {"a b"} (the braces are for Kermit, the doublequotes are for UNIX).
Note that quoting space with \ still does not work (e.g. DIRECTORY a\ b), nor
has it ever.  ckucmd.c 5A(065), 2 Sep 94.

Added code to display which TCP/IP DLL was loaded to OS/2 version of SHOW NET.
ckuus4.c, ckonet.c 5A(031), 3 Sep 94.

New code and makefile for OS/2 C-Kermit to support FTP Software 16-bit PC/TCP
from Jeff Altman.  ckoker.mak, ..., ckonet.c 5A(031) 2 Sep 94.  A new set of
DLLs now goes on the OS/2 C-Kermit disk, and is handled by the installation
procedure, and the appropriate one is loaded automatically at startup.

Fixed ASK and ASKQ to not save their responses in the command-recall buffer.
ckuus6.c ckucmd.c, 3 Sep 94.

This is Beta.20

When sending a file group in local mode and some of the files are rejected
(size, date, name, whatever), the file transfer display thermometer would go
nuts.  Fixed in ckuusx.c, 4 Sep 94.

Added \v(modem) (current SET MODEM value) and \v(evaluate) (result of most
recent EVALUATE command).  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, ckuusr.c 5A(150), 5 Sep 94.

Updates to OS/2 .inf file, make file, install script, external protocol
scripts, etc, from Jeff Altman.  Added a new external protocol script for
CEXYZ/2 from Jim Reisert.  5 Sep 94.

Make DIAL module echo commands sent to the modem if DIAL DISPLAY is ON and
DUPLEX is set to HALF.  Also make DIAL module not treat "964" response from
Telebit model-number inquiry as if it were a "4" (ERROR).  Reported by Simon
Casady <cap@hces.com>.  ckudia.c 5A(061) 5 Sep 94.

This is Beta.21

Fixed DECREQTPARM report in OS/2 VT220 emulator to correctly indicate 7 or
8 bit mode, taking TERMINAL BYTESIZE setting into account.  Noticed by
Andrew Orndorff <aorndorff@nhtsa.dot.gov>.  ckocon.c 5A(153), 6 Sep 94.

Added \N to OUTPUT string to send a NUL.  Prior to this, there was no way
to send a NUL from a script program.  ckuusr.c 5A(151), 9 Sep 94.

Various #ifdef cleanups from Mike Long, ckuus*.c, 9 Sep 94.

Changes from Jeff Altman to allow coexistence of OS/2 C-Kermit 5A(190) with
the "fake TCPIPDLL" that was distributed with 5A(189).  ckonet.c 5A(032),
9 Sep 94.  Also, changes to the makefile, cko*.def files, etc.

This is Beta.22.

A new OS/2 icon.  Also in OS/2, allow Named Pipe handles on the server to be
inherited by child processes (such as P.EXE).  Jeff Altman.  ckonet.c 5A(033),
11 Sep 94.

Added SET TELNET NEWLINE-MODE RAW to send CR as just a bare CR, in addition to
ON (send CR as CRLF) and OFF (send CR and CR-NUL), for use when talking to
non-TELNET servers that do not react poorly to both CRLF and CR-NUL (such as
certain rlogin-based modem servers).  Suggested (most recently) by Kerry Schwab
<kschwab@healthcare.com>.  ckcnet.h (symbols), ckcnet.c (default), ckuus3.c
(SET TELNET command), ckuus4.c (OUTPUT command), ckcfn2.c (packets), ckuusr.c
5A(152), ckucon.c (CONNECT) 5A(073), 15 Sep 94.

Also: ckvcon.c 5A(036), ckocon.c 5A(154), ckdcon.c 5A(046), cklcon.c 5A(005),
15 Sep 94.

Bill Chen <chen@columbia.edu> noticed that (a) WRITE-LINE SESSION-LOG added
material to the session log out of sequence, and (b) this command would core
dump if given after opening, using, and closing the session log.  The problem
was that zsoutl() was not coded in parallel with zsout() in ckufio.c.  The
latter (and also zchout()) used unbuffered i/o for the session log, but
buffered i/o elsewhere.  Also, zsoutl() was not checking the file descriptor
before writing to it.  ckufio.c 5A(097) 15 Sep 94.

From Mike Long <mike.long@analog.com>: Fix a backwards #ifdef regarding IEXTEN
in UNIX ttpkt(): ckutio.c 5A(154).  Fix an incorrect #ifdef for selecting the
SHOW NETWORK command, ckuusr.c.  Plug a hole in the decode() logic in which a
variable (a7) could be used when not initialized, ckcfns.c 5A(119), 15 Sep 94.
Also remove double inclusion of ckcsym.h from ckcmai.c.

Put contents of UNIX ttgwsiz() within #ifndef NONAWS, because evidently some
systems (AT&T 3B2) define TIOCGWINSZ in their header files but do not define
the associated winsize struct, which causes compilation of ckutio.c to fail.
ckutio.c 5A(154), 15 Sep 94.

New Amiga ckitio.c from Steve Walton, fixes timeouts, adds modem signal
support.  16 Sep 94.

Adapting SUNX25 support to Solaris 2.3 + SunLink X.25 8.0, 16 Sep 94....  Had
to change ckcnet.h to allow SUNX25 under SOLARIS as well as under SunOS.  Had
to remove #includes for <sys/mbuf.h> and <sys/domain.h> since they don't exist
under Solaris.  Added #include for <sys/sockio.h>.  Fixed bad call to
x25reset() in ckucon.c.  The X.25 get/set facilities function had totally
changed (e.g. reverse-charge, closed user group, etc).  Also, various
ANSIfications were needed.  All of this taken care of in ckcnet.h and ckcnet.c
5A(037).  New makefile entry, solaris2x25, added for this.  Compiles and links
OK, but doesn't work: connect() complains that "address family and protocol
family do not agree".  There are evidently some additional differences between
the old and new versions of SunLink that I haven't figured out yet.  Sample
programs supplied with new SunLink are still the old ones and don't work.
Needs more work, which will have to wait till I get documentation & access.

Fix for SET TELNET TERMINAL-TYPE for OS/2 from Jeff Altman.  ckcnet.c 5A(038),
17 Sep 94.

Discovered that C-Kermit, when sending a file and the file was rejected
because of size, type, etc, which means that the transfer failed, still
reported success, when it should have failed.  In general, a file transfer
should fail whenever an attribute rejection occurs EXCEPT if the rejection
indicates that the file did not need to be transferred because it was already
there, namely if the reason was "date" (#) (SET FILE COLLISION UPDATE) or name
(SET FILE COLLISION DISCARD / NO-SUPERSEDE).  A new attribute tag was added to
indicate the latter case: "?" means "name", but can only be used in attribute
replies, not in A-packets themselves (because A packets are not encoded, but
filenames might have to be).  ckcfn*.c 5A(120), ckcpro.w 5A(071), 17 Sep 94.

The treatment by HP-UX 10.00 of UUCP lockfiles turns out to be so different
from all the others that I had to write an entire custom version of ttlock()
for it, allowing for (a) four or more possible different names for the same
dialout device, and (b) creation of two lockfile names rather than just one
(sometimes), plus the cleaning up of any number of stale lockfiles, plus
allowances for symbolic links to device names, plus recovery from all sorts
of errors, etc.  An all-day+night project.  ckutio.c 5A(155), 17 Sep 94.

Added a message when C-Kermit interrupted during initialization file or
command-line processing to let user know why it is disappearing.  Suggested
by Eduard Vopicka.  ckcmai.c 5A(190), 18 Sep 94.

Some fixes to yesterday's work on file transfer success/failure.  ckcfn*.c,
ckcpro.w.

Made -h command-line option imply -Y, i.e. if all they want is the command-line
help screen, don't bother reading in the init file, since Kermit will exit
anyway as soon as the help screen is printed.  ckuus4.c, 18 Sep 94.

Fixed a bug in command recall reported by Clifford L. Pelletier
<PELLETIER@CCSUA.CTSTATEU.EDU>, with help from Jeff Altman.  ckucmd.c 5A(066),
18 Sep 94.

Fixed the "more?" prompter to be smart enough not to prompt if it knows
it's on the last line of the text.  ckuus2.c, 18 Sep 94.

This is Beta.23.

A couple minor corrections to #ifdefs based on compiling it in dozens of
different environments...  Added a new makefile entry for LynxOS 2.1, from
Michael Brennen <mbrennen@maverick.intecom.com>.  19 Sep 94.

Added -DCK_NEWTERM to dynixptx20c makefile entry to fix terminal-mode problems
reported by Tom Kloos at Sequent.  Also, a correction to a typo in ckuusx.c
from Tom.  20 Sep 94.

New Stratus VOS files from David Lane: Automatic recovery from incomplete
packet sends, updated documentation, simulated "curses" support, new binaries
and updated docs.  20 Sep 94.

Fixes to 4.4BSD priv_xxx() package from John Kohl <jtk@kolvir.blrc.ma.us>.
ckutio.c 5A(156).  Also, John updated the ckuuid program to test for 4.4BSD
semantics.

From Mike Long: "4.4BSD doesn't have the lockf() function.  I verified this by
checking the original 4.4BSD distribution that freebsd.cdrom.com has up for
FTP.  So the following is probably appropriate (also fixes an unterminated
comment that gcc -Wall found)" -- patches to ckutio.c, 21 Sep 94.

From Steven Schultz <sms@WLV.IIPO.GTEGSC.COM>: BSDI does not use string-format
PIDs in lockfiles.  ckutio.c 5A(157), 22 Sep 94.

Changed ASK and ASKQ to take "comments" literally.  ckucmd.c, 26 Sep 94.

Increased max wildcard matches from 500 to 4096 in VMS C-Kermit,
ckvfio.c 5A(114), 29 Sep 94.

Fixed a prototype in ckcnet.c so SunLink X.25 code would compile again under
SunOS 4.1.x and old (pre-8.00, not sure exactly which version) SunLink.
Compiles, links, runs, and even works -- CONNECT, file transfer (7 and 8 bit),
various SET and SHOW commands all tested successfully.  ckcnet.c 5A(039),
30 Sep 94.

Numerous improvements to #ifdefs (esp NOLOCAL and NOSERVER) and removal of
declarations for unused variables, from Mike Long.  Many modules.  1 Oct 94.

Many other similar cleanups in other modules.

Increased OS/2 C-Kermit's HANGUP interval for dropping DTR from 1/2 sec to
one full second, suggested by Ric Anderson.  1 Oct 94.

Fixed OS/2 C-Kermit's display of TELNET TERMINAL-TYPE.  ckuus4.c, 1 Oct 94.

Added an #ifdef to enable REDIRECT support for Sony News (like NeXT) from
Bernard Chen <bern@CS.UCLA.EDU>, ckutio.c 5A(158) 1 Oct 94.

Discovered that somehow in the past month I seem to have destroyed the
much-touted benefits of SET COMMAND QUOTING OFF, e.g. for entering DOS
filespecs in their natural form.  The code for this command had a part of it
commented out (the part that makes the xxstring function pointer either point
to the real string processing function, zzstring(), or else NULL), so I
uncommented it and that fixed everything right up.  I can't remember why I
commented it out previously, so that's a little worrisome...
ckuus3.c, 1 Oct 94.

Jeff Altman noticed that MINPUT 30 {\13\10$ } ... ... didn't work.  Yup,
setatm() was breaking on the CR.  I changed SETATM to accept any characters
at all that are inside braces.  ckucmd.c 5A(067), 2 Oct 94.

Due to the accumulated weight of questions and complaints about the often
wildly fluctuating CPS figure in the fullscreen file transfer display, I
#ifdef'd out the weighted calculation and restored the simple, flat average.
The 1/4 weighted CPS can be put back with -DCPS_WEIGHTED; Vince Fatica's
formula can substituted by adding -DCPS_VINCE.  shocps(), ckuusx.c, 2 Oct 94.

Added SET CMD and SHOW CMD as invisible synonyms for SET COMMAND and SHOW
COMMAND.  ckuusr.c, 2 Oct 94.

This is Beta.24.

Updated MINPUT help message (spaces, not commas, separate items).
ckuus2.c, 4 Oct 94.

Fixed a type in the dynixptx20c makefile entry, reported by Tom Kloos.
4 Oct 94.

Added 57600 bps for BSDI.  makefile, 4 Oct 94.

Added automatic recognition of Telebit Qblazer Plus to dial module and plugged
a nearby possibly null-pointer derefencing, thanks to Brian Utterback
<blu@jericho.mc.com>, ckudia.c 5A(062), 4 Oct 94.

William Bader noticed that if C-Kermit received (for example) "apc ls -l",
and he then Ctrl-C'd out of "ls", that PUSH, !, RUN, etc, did not work any
more.  Fixed in ckuusx.c.  4 Oct 94.

Eduard Vopicka said to change from using rdchk() to poll() in SCO UNIX
3.2v4, so I did -- he's the expert.  makefile, 4 Oct 94.

Fixed a malloc/free problem that could result in a segmentation fault when
INPUT and MINPUT were called alternately and repeatedly, noticed by
Corey Minyard <minyard@wf-rch.cirr.com>.  ckuusr.c 5A(156), 4 Oct 94.

Shuffled the 2.10/2.11 BSD overlays to make them all fit within their
alloted sizes.  ckubs2.mak, 4 Oct 94.

Changed UNIX congm() not give an error message and fail if it can't
open "/dev/tty", but instead to just go ahead and use 0 as the file
descriptor.  This is for cases where "/dev/tty" does not exist, i.e. when
there is no controlling terminal, e.g. when launched from a daemon.
ckutio.c 5A(159) 4 Oct 94.

Revised the makefile entry for Solaris 2.3 / SunLink X.25.

Added a makefile entry for IBM AIX 4.1 and 4.1.1.

Added TELNET CR handling to DIAL and SCRIPT command execution.
ckudia.c 5A(063) and ckuscr.c 5A(023).

From Mark Berryman: RESEND support for VMS.  ckvfio.c 5A(115) 4 Oct 94,
ckcfn3.c, ckcdeb.h.  zfseek() routine added to ckvfio.c.  It is strictly
block-oriented, since all binary file transfers in VMS are also block-oriented.
Later, fix resending to stop at FFB. ckvfio.c 5A(116).

Fix for OS/2 C-Kermit DECnet support from Jeff A.  ckonet.c 5A(035), 4 Oct 94.

Fix for OS/2 C-Kermit DECnet file transfer.  ckonet.c 5A(036), 4 Oct 94.

Removed the word "Beta" from the version herald.  ckcmai.c 5A(190), 4 Oct 94.

========================= released 5A(190) 4 Oct 94 ==========================

Fixed bug in server in which "get blah" (where file blah does not exist)
followed by "send foo" resulted in "unexpected packet type" error.  ckcpro.w
5A(073) 14 Feb 95.  The fix is in "<serve>R", change "if (sinit() >= 0)" to
"if (sinit() > 0)".

Added code to TCP/IP section of netopen() to try additional IP addresses
returned in hostent structure (if any), in case first IP address doesn't
connect.  This code is used only if HADDRLIST is defined at compile time, and
then only if h_addr is also defined, presumably in <netdb.h>.  ckcnet.c
5A(041), 20 Feb 95.  Can't test it, but it doesn't seem to break normal
connections.

Changed telnet code to reply to WONT ECHO with DONT ECHO if the SGA flag
is set.  A certain telnet server, gatekeeper.epsilon.com, seems to hang if
if this reply does not come.  The risk is that we might get caught in a
negotiation loop.  Needs testing.  5A(042), 20 Feb 95.

Changed APC command to use communication channel, rather than always using
stdout, like MS-DOS Kermit 3.14.  ckuusr.c 5A(157), 20 Feb 95.

Fixed dooutput() to account for the case when its argument ends in a
backslash.  Previously, it was impossible to OUTPUT any string that ended
with a backslash.  ckuus4.c, 20 Feb 95.

Added code to ckucon.c to guard against APC buffer overruns, e.g. when APC
arrives as garbage, followed by many K of stray characters.  Previously, we
would stay in string-gathering mode until the terminator came and then attempt
to execute the partial APC, which could be a disaster.  Now we just discard it
and go back to normal mode immediately (otherwise we'd be hung if no ST were
to arrive).  ckucon.c 5A(074) 22 Feb 95.  Sent changes to Jeff A for OS/2
version.  Still need to add to VMS, etc.

Russian keyboard mode for OS/2 C-K. 22 Feb 95.

Fix from Jeff A for Telnet negotiations; C-K was neglecting handle
DONT TERMINAL_TYPE.  ckcnet.c 5A(043) 23 Feb 95.

Changes from ulli@Vincent.LfM.rwth-aachen.de (Ulrich Schlueter) for OS-9:
 . Add automatic directory changing and creation for OS-9
 . Add automatic parity detection for OS-9
 . Don't call sleep(0) (OS-9 treats this as sleep(infinity)
 . Fix command-recall display for OS-9
 . Add text/binary session log for OS-9
 . And fix for bug: you RESEND a file from a remote kermit and then put it in
   server mode, escape back to your local kermit and issue a GET command in
   text mode, then the message "Refused: disposition" will appear because
   'sendmode' is still set to SM_RESEND, therefore reset sendmode to SM_SEND
   before server mode is entered.
Many modules, 24 Feb 95.   
 
Some small changes to VMS modules to allow compilation with DEC C on VAX,
which was not possible before, from Martin P.J. Zinser, Gesellschaft
fuer Schwerionenforschung GSI, Darmstadt <zinser@axp603.gsi.de>.  24 Feb 95.

Some small changes for __FreeBSD__ from Andrew Chernov <ache@astral.msk.su>.
ckutio.c 5A(161), 24 Feb 95.

Enclose stray reference to deblog() in ckuusx.c in #ifdef DEBUG..#endif.
From Steve Layten, Chemical Abstracts.  24 Feb 95.

Fix for SCO ODT 3.0 dialing from Rob Weiner <robert@progplus.com> - use
nap() rather than poll() in msleep().  ckutio.c 5A(161), 24 Feb 95.

From Tom Pinkl <tom@hbsrx.com>, make UNIX zshcmd() return child's exit status,
so script programs can check success/failure of RUN commands.  ckufio.c
5A(099), ckuusr.c 5A(159), 24 Feb 95.

Minor corrections to various messages, etc.  ckuus2.c.

Fix SHOW SERVER to show all items.  Conditionalize all references to
"copy".  Conditionalize various unprotected ANSIisms that snuck in since
October.  etc etc.

For non-OS/2 systems, the intentions of the changes of recent days is to
fix a few minor problems, but not to introduce any new functionality, and
to integrate the updated sources for OS/2 and OS-9.  For non-OS/2 systems,
the version number remains at 5A(190), but with a new date.

Compiled OK on SunOS 4.1.3 (non-ANSI), Solaris 2.4 (SPARC and Intel) (ANSI),
HP-UX (ANSI and non-ANSI).

More from Ulli Schlueter:
 . Fix off-by-one error in initialization of command recall buffer.
 . Fix confusion after character deletion over {}'s in command processor,
   e.g. "xif eq {} {}^H} {echo y} else {echo n}".
ckucmd.c 5A(069) 2 Mar 95.
 . SET TERM FONT was not in OS2 conditionals.
 . Prevent "ok to hang up?" response from overwriting name of new host
   in setlin().
ckuus7.c / ckuusr.c 5A(160), 2 Mar 95.
 . Server was not ACKing REMOTE RENAME / COPY.
ckcpro.w 5A(074) 2 Mar 95.
 . Add OS-9 support in ckhost().
ckuusx.c / ckuusr.c 5A(160), 2 Mar 95.
 . Add TCP/IP support for OS-9.
ckcnet.h, ckuusy.c, ck9*.*.  It can now be built with or without TCP/IP.

From Jeff A - fix an array reference in a debug() statement to check that
the subscript is in range.  This was causing the OS/2 version to crash if
debug log was on during CONNECT mode.  ckuus5.c, 4 Mar 95.

From Ulli S - DEC TCP/IP (UCX) getservbyname() never worked right -- calling
it, e.g. via "kermit -j blah" or "telnet blah telnet", would crash the
program in VMS.  Ulli supplied a replacement.  ckcnet.c 5A(044) 7 Mar 95.

Added MOVE and MMOVE commands.  Just like SEND and MSEND, but they delete
each source file after sending it successfully.  ckuusr.[ch] 5A(161),
ckcpro.w 5A(075), 1 Apr 95.

Added SET TELNET BINARY-MODE { DISABLED, ENABLED }.  ckuusr.h, ckuus[34].c,
ckcnet.c 5A(047), 1 Apr 95.

Made necessary changes to get C-Kermit to compile and link under IRIX 6.01.
Many modules, all changes minor, to satisfy overzealous type-checking
compiler.

Changed DIAL MNP default to ON.  Changed DIAL SPEED-MATCHING default to OFF.
Added DIAL ERROR-CORRECTION and DIAL COMPRESSION commands, but for now they
are just synonyms for MNP.  ckudia.c 5A(065), ckuus7.c, 15 Apr 95.

Added dial init-strings for various types of modems as comments to CKERMOD.INI.
Added XDIAL macro to CKERMIT.INI.  Fixed UNIXLOGIN macro not to look for \13.
Added DEC Store entries to sample dialing and services directories.
15 Apr 95.

Fixed a bug in \fcontents() that prevented it from evaluating array names
correctly.  ckuus4.c, 17 Apr 95.

========== released 5A(191) 24 Apr 95 for OS/2 only ========================

Fixed a bug in INPUT that made it drop every 256th character.  ckuus4.c.
23 May 95.

Added -lmalloc to SCO UNIX 3.2v4 makefile entries to make it use SCO's
malloc, rather than the one in libc.a, which was crashing.  24 May 94.
From Tom Pinkl.

Fix TRANSMIT command to obey TELNET NEWLINE setting and to double IACs on
TELNET connections.  ckuus4.c, 25 May 95.

Added #ifdef TNCODE around these changes.  ckuus4.c, 31 May 95.

Fixed bug in ASK/ASQ in which deletion of entered material could sometimes
delete too much.  ckuus6.c, 31 May 95.

Added -8 (8-bit clean) command-line option.  ckuusy.c, 3 Jun 95.

Remove #ifdef ZCOPY..#endif from around REMOTE COPY command.  ckuusr.c,
4 Jun 95.

June 10-11, 1995:  Overhaul DIAL mechanism.  Here are very rough notes, to
be prettied up later:

Changed DIAL MNP default to ON.  Changed DIAL SPEED-MATCHING default to OFF.
Added DIAL ERROR-CORRECTION and DIAL COMPRESSION commands, but for now they
are just synonyms for MNP.  ckudia.c 5A(065), ckuus7.c, 15 Apr 95.

Added dial init-strings for various types of modems as comments to CKERMOD.INI.
Added XDIAL macro to CKERMIT.INI.  Fixed UNIXLOGIN macro not to look for \13.
Added DEC Store entries to sample dialing and services directories.
15 Apr 95.

Incompatibilities:

  No more v34-telebit, v42-telebit, slow-telebit.
  No more automatic sensing of many Telebit models, now just NEW and OLD.
  Use other SET commands to accomplish these effects.
  SHOW COMM doesn't show DIAL settings any more.

[ OK ] Put support for old modems in #ifdef OLDMODEM..#endif.
       Define OLDMODEM by default
       M_OLD makes old modem names invisible (keep, but hide)

[ OK ] Get rid of special handling for Telebits.

[ OK ] Got rid of "augmdmtyp", "mymdmtyp", etc.

[ OK ] add "name" (description) to MDMINF structure?

[ OK ] add separate SET commands for non init-string items:

SET DIAL STRING { ERROR-CORRECTION, COMPRESSION } { ON, OFF } [ string ]
SET DIAL STRING { HANGUP, HWFC, SWFC, NOFC } [ string ]
SET DIAL STRING { DIAL-COMMAND, INITIALIZATION, PREFIX } [ string ] <- synonyms

[ OK ] Make previous string commands invisible but still accept them.

[ OK ] SET DIAL FLOW-CONTROL { HARD, SOFT, NONE }
[ OK ] Add  SET DIAL FLOW-CONTROL to SHOW DIAL

[ OK ] Add all of the above into the ckudia module.

[ no ] Turn flow control off during dialing, restore it when CONNECTed.
       This would actually be done in ttpkt() when the flow argument is
       DIALING.  This could be done by treating DIALING as NONE.  A bit risky.

[ OK ] Make SHOW COMM not include SHOW DIAL, but just a pointer to it.

[ OK ] Don't keep dialing directory open.

[ OK ] move mdminf struct definition to ckcker.h.

[ OK ] Moved BREAK transparency to init string, since we always want it.

[ OK ] SET DIAL COMPRESSION, ERROR-CORRECTION
       ON  means enable it in the modem it if the modem has it.
       OFF means disable it in the modem it if the modem has it.

[ OK ] COMPRESSION ON => ERROR-CORRECTION ON
[ OK ] ERROR-CORRECTION OFF => COMPRESSION OFF
[ OK ] SET MODEM should override previous SET DIAL INIT

[ OK ] Get rid of all references to dialmnp,
       make MNP-ENABLE be a synonym for ERROR-CORRECTION.

[ OK ] Add to modem structure:

     capabilities:
       EC      if ec_on_str is not NULL or ""
       DC      if dc_on_str is not NULL or ""
       SB      recycle sb_auto_action
       HWFC    if hwfc_str ...
       SWFC    if swfc_str ...
       Kermit spoof

[ OK ] SET MODEM to a particular modem sets COMPRESSION, EC, and SPEED-MATCHING
       ON or OFF according to the modem's capabilities.

[ OK ] Flow control:

DIAL FLOW == *local* flow-control for modem,
set automatically to AUTO when SET MODEM is given.

if DIAL FLOW == RTS/CTS ..OR..
   DIAL FLOW == AUTO && flow == RTS/CTS
     then set it from dialhwfc or mp->hwfc, if any, else warn

else if DIAL FLOW == XON/XOFF ..OR..
   DIAL FLOW == AUTO && flow == XON/XOFF && EC is ON <-- (note!)
     then set it from dialswfc or mp->swfc, if any, else warn

else if DIAL FLOW == NONE
     then set it from dialnofc or mp->nofc, if any, else warn

[ OK ] BUT now allow for SET DIAL { STRING, FLOW } overrides ...

[ no ] Add SET DIAL METHOD { TONE, PULSE } ???

[ OK ] Clean up Telebit mess.

[ no ] Do something about interface speed vs modulation speed in stats?

[ OK ] Add WINDIAL type.

[ OK ] Update SHOW DIAL <-- keep doing this

[    ] Update help messages...

[    ] Write instructions for adding a new modem type.

LOOSE ENDS:

[    ] What do do about generations of same modem -

PPI and friends...  Do all models pick the highest modulation method
automatically, so this need not be set?  ditto for others?

Hayes and friends...  Do we need separate entries for Hayes Optima,
Accura, etc?

TESTING:

Build on OS/2, HP, or NeXT where I can test.

Test CCITT

WRITE IT up...

So instructions should say SET MODEM first, then SET DIAL to override
any modem-specific settings that were picked up automatically.

However, since settings can be given in any order, we don't really know for
sure what they are until after the DIAL cmd is given, so we can't really
check things until then.

(much more DIAL work ...)

Added SET ALARM / IF ALARM / SHOW ALARM.  ckuus*.[ch], 19 Jun 95.

It seems that { braces } could not be used in the expected manner on
\function() args, i.e. for grouping, as they can be in MS-DOS Kermit; another
blow to portable script programming.  What was worse, without being able to
use braces for grouping, it was next to impossible to include a comma or a
parenthesis as part of a function argument.  Fixed in ckuus4.c, 22 Jun 95.
To illustrate:
                        Old    New
  \flength(abc)          3      3
  \flength({abc})        5      3
  \flength(a{b}c)        5      3
  \flength({{abc}})      7      5
  \flength(a,b,c)        1      1
  \flength({a,b,c})      2      5
  \flength(a{,}b{,}c)    9      5

Note that only outermost braces are stripped, and inner ones are kept, so
whenever you need to include braces themselves, just double them up.

\fliteral() is an exception, since various constructions already in use
counted on it preserving braces (e.g. the dialing & services directories,
while loops, etc).  However, \fliteral now (for the first time) returns its
entire argument literally, even if it contains commas.  Previously, commas and
parentheses were sacred and of the highest priority to the function argument
parser.  Alpha.007.

Added REGET.  Client end: add "reget" to command table (ckuusr.h, ckuusr.c),
use GET command parser, but remember that the command was REGET (doget() in
ckuus6.c).  Send J-packet (new packet type) instead of R-packet (ckcpro.w,
ckcfn2.c).  Server end: handle incoming J packets, just like incoming R
packets, but remember that we're resending instead of just sending.  This
required adding one more action, and moving the code for the former GET
action (<server>R) to a routine that could be shared between <server>R and
<server>J.  Also, twiddled some #ifdefs so -DNOICP would automatically
set NOCSETS -- ckcker.h, ckcxla.h, ckuus4.c, etc, and ensured that -DNOICP
by itself without any other -DNOxxx's would result in a clean build.
Alpha.008, 23 Jun 95.

Richard Staunton at Berkeley discovered a problem that was introduced by my
fixing \fliteral() -- it appeared to break the dialing directory, although the
real explanation was that there was some very low-level code in the command
parser that depended on the old (broken) behavior, which wound up causing big
problems when trying to execute a macro that was defined inside an XIF,
WHILE, or FOR construction (as XDIAL is).  Fixed in litcmd() in ckuus5.c.
Also, Added "generic Rockwell" modem types for V.32, V.32bis, V.34.  Untested.
ckudia.c 5A(069) 24 Jun 95.  Alpha.009.

Changed UNIX zchki() to allow for FIFOs as well as regular files.
Suggested by Glenn Thobe <thobe@getunx.quake.com>.  This lets Kermit both
send and receive FIFOs, providing a new mechanism for pre- and postprocessing
of transferred data.  Added SET DIAL LOCAL-AREA-CODE to allow for
area-independent dialing directories.  Totally untested.  Alpha.010, 25 Jun 95.

From Ulli Schlueter... Some fixes for REGET (restoring file type and
collision after, etc); add null device support (/dev/nil) for OS-9; a bit
of support TELNET binary mode in ckucon.c (I hadn't gotten around to doing
this yet); DIAL interrupt handler fix for OS-9; fixes for ZyXEL modem
commands; fixes to poll() calls for SCO; corrections to SHOW TELNET display;
support for SPACE <device> command for OS-9; askmore() fixes for OS-9;
CRT file-transfer display fixes.  June 26.

Merged in recent changes from Jeff Altman for XXX.  Added \frindex(s1,s2,n),
"right index", which, ignoring the rightmost n characters (if n is given) in
s2, returns the position (index) in s2 of the rightmost occurrence of the
string s1.  Added \fverify(s1,s2,n), which returns the position (index) of the
first character in s2 that is not also in s1.  If n is given, we only look at
s2 beginning at position n.  Use for pre-verifying hex numbers, phone
numbers, etc etc.  ckuusr.[ch], ckuus4.c.  Alpha.011, 3 Jul 95.

Relaxed syntax on array references to allow spaces in them, as in \&a[ 3 ] or
\&a[ \feval( 1 + 1 ) ].  Increased maximum variable name length VNAML from 20
to 32, and separated array refs from other variables names by tying their max
length to a new symbol, ARRAYREFLEN, which is now defined in ckuusr.h to be
80.  ckuus5.c, 4 Jul 95.

Allow partial DIAL commands for Hayes-like modems.  If a DIAL command results
in an OK or 0 response, count it as SUCCESS rather than FAILURE, but report
"Partial call complete" rather than "Call complete", and set \v(dial_status)
to a new value, 11, meaning partial call complete.  This allows calls to be
placed in several steps by ending a partial number with a semicolon (feature
of Hayes-like modems).  ckudia.c.

Whenever a serial line is closed implicitly, either by SET LINE or by EXIT,
and it is an open modem connection, then call mdmhup() before calling
ttclos().  This way, if a modem-hangup string is defined, it will be used to
ensure the modem is hung up, plus if the user has redefined the DIAL COMMAND
HANGUP string, e.g. to turn call-waiting back on, as is necessary in some
PBXs, that will be done too.  ckuusr.c, ckuus7.c.

Fleshed out the Microcom SX-command-mode support a bit.  Totally untested.

OS-9 updates from Ulli.  Alpha.013, 7 Jul 95.

Added SET MODEM CARRIER as synonym for SET CARRIER.  ckuus3.c, 8 Jul 95.

Jeff Altman restructured ckcmai.c to allow a more flexible style of exception
handling, since the old setjmp/signal/longjmp-out-of-signal-handler model
doesn't necessarily work in multithreaded environments.  8 Jul 95.

Added control-character (un)prefixing info to STATISTICS display.
ckcmai.c, ckcfns.c, ckuus4.c, 9 Jul 95.

Added two lines to arraynam() in ckuus5.c that allows the array subscript
to be treated as an expression and evaluated as if it were enclosed in
\fneval().  So now we can write \&a[\%i + 1], which is simpler and easier to
read than \&a[\fneval(\%i+1)].  Added to MSK also.  12 Jul 95.

Added new function \fipaddr(s,n).  Finds and returns the first IP address
in string s starting at position n (= 1 by default).  IP address must be
four decimal numeric fields of 1-3 digits each, separated by commas.  No
range checking is done (i.e. for 255 or less), though it easily could be.
12 Jul 95.

Fixed compilation error in ckcnet.c for Motorola SV/88R4 regarding arg type
to setsockopt().  12 Jul 95.

Jeff A's reworking of exception handling extended to all the other modules
that needed it, including ckudia.c, ckuscr.c, and ckcnet.c.  A new source
module was added that implements UNIX-style exception handling: ckusig.c,
and there is an accompanying ckusig.h header file.  All C-Kermit build
procedures will have to be changed to accommodate this new module, and the
dependencies on the header file (which presently occur in ckcmai.c, ckcnet.c,
ckudia.c, ckuscr.c, and ckusig.c).  The UNIX makefile was updated for this.
The resulting version builds OK on SunOS 4.1.3 (non-ANSI) and NeXTSTEP (gcc,
strict ANSI), and runs OK in both places, handling Ctrl-C's and timeouts OK.
OS's that can't handle UNIX-style exception handling, particularly longjmps
out of signal handlers, will need ck?sig.[ch] modules of their own.
Alpha.014, 15 Jul 95.

Added IBM Mwave modem support.  ckudia.c, 19 Jul 95.

Added Zoltrix modem support.  ckudia.c, 20 Jul 95.

Fixed DIAL timeout to never be less than 25 seconds, and S7 value to never
be less than 20.  ckudia.c, 20 Jul 95.

Added new makefile entry for NCR SVR4 MPRAS 2.03.00 from Peter Binderup.
20 Jul 95.

Fixed ckusig.h and ckusig.c to not spew out compiler warnings about "&"
being ignored or passing of incompatible pointer types.  Also ckcmai.c,
ckudia.c, ckuscr.c.  20-21 Jul 95.  Alpha.015.

Added CLEAR DIAL-STATUS.  ckuusr.[ch]
Added dial status to SHOW DIAL display.  ckuus4.c.
Added dial status strings to SHOW DIAL display if BIGBUFOK defined.  ckuus4.c.

Changed DIAL command not to hang up if dial-status = "partial" (11),
and also to skip all initializations.  ckudia.c.  21 Jul 95.

Massive changes begin 23 Jul 95.  Dialing directory format changed to name and
number only, no more speed or parity.

 . Entries are now read by getnct(), so all the same rules about comments
   and continuation apply as for command files.
 . There is no more partial match -- i.e. you can no longer abbreviate an
   an entry name in your DIAL command.
 . You can have multiple entries with the same name, in which case C-K will
   dial each one until it gets an answer, or uses up the list.  There is no
   artificial limit on the number of such entries.
 . DIAL == REDIAL if not given a number to dial.
 . Wordy messages are surpressed after the first dialing attempt.

Changed getnct() to have two addt'l args: file descriptor, so it can be
told which file to read (dialing directory or TAKE file); and a flag that
says whether to leave on the line terminator (0, for TAKE files) or to strip
it off (1, for dialing directory entries).

Changed xwords() to have an addt'l arg, flag, that says whether final
"word" should be the rest of the string (1) or, as before, a single word
like all the others.  23 Jul 95.

Added LOOKUP command to look up entries dialing directory exactly like
DIAL would, but without dialing.  24 Jul 95.

Changed dialing-directory lookup strategy to allow abbreviated search string,
as before, but only as long as all the names that it matches are the same.  If
not, an informative message is printing, giving examples of two different
names that matched, and if this happens we don't proceed with dialing.
Ditto if there is any other kind of bad error with directory -- can't open,
etc.  ludial(), ckuus6.c, 25 Jul 95.

Allowed for multiple dialing directories, up to MAXDDIR (== 12) of them.
Search proceeds through all of them.  Since dialing directory is opened each
time a DIAL command is given, relative paths might give different results,
which can be a good thing if used properly, e.g. you could have the search
order be a system-wide directory, then a home one, then a file in the current
directory, no matter what the current directory is.
ckuusr.[ch], ckuus[346].c, ckudia.c,  26 Jul 95.

Note: when dialing multiple numbers or doing retries, we still go through
the whole hangup and modem configuration sequence, since we can't be sure
that a dial failure has not altered the modem's settings or left the
connection open.

Added detection for old-style directories.  This involved writing, at long
last, Kermit's own "index()" function (since many C libraries don't have one),
ckindex() in ckuus4.c, and having \findex() and \frindex() use it, and then
also using it to search for any of the five parity names in the recovered
phone number.  It would have been easier (and better) to call xwords() first
the old way and then check index[4] and index[5] against speeds and parities
(and "="), but unfortunately, xwords() pokes NULs into its argument string,
so it could not be called a second time on the same string.  So then I went
back and did right, so now we have a decent index function AND a good
directory-checker.

Protocol: When a REMOTE command resulted in a short-form reply, it did not
set the SUCCESS flag, so if the previous command had failed, it would also
look as if the successful REMOTE command did too.  ckcpro.w 5A(078)
26 Jul 95.

Fixed -m command-line option to initialize modem from database exactly
the way SET MODEM TYPE does.  ckuusy.c, 27 Jul 95.

Moved yes/no parsing code to a separate routine, getyesno(msg), where msg
is the question to ask.  ckuus3.c, 27 Jul 95.

Added code to detect old-style dialing directories and use them, and also
to detect mixed old- and new-format entries, which is fatal.  An old-format
directory is identified if any entries have parity field; a new-format
directory is identified if any phone numbers start with "+" or if there are
any full-line comments.  ckuus6.c, 27 Jul 95.

If an old-style directory is discovered, we ask the user "Shall I convert
it?", and if they say yes, we do.  ckuus6.c, 27 Jul 95.

Fixed ckcsig.h, which had some typos in it for the CK_POSIX_SIG case.
28 Jul 95.

Added -T (telephony) command-line option, which so far does nothing.
ckuusy.c, 28 Jul 95.

Added "Default file-transfer mode is { TEXT, BINARY }" message to startup.
Almost-Alpha.016, 28 Jul 95.

Fixed -DNOCCTRAP compilation, merged in Jeff's changes to date.  30 Jul 95.

Fixed -DNODIAL compilation.  Difference between full dialing capability
and none at all on Sun-4 is 64K (so far).  30 Jul 95.

Fixed various compilation errors on VMS.  Builds OK on VMS 5.5-2 with
UCX and VAX C.  30 Jul 95.

Added table entries, parsing, and SHOW for the following SET DIAL commands:

  SET DIAL CONFIRMATION
  SET DIAL CONVERT-DIRECTORY
  SET DIAL LD-PREFIX
  SET DIAL LD-SUFFIX
  SET DIAL INTL-PREFIX
  SET DIAL INTL-SUFFIX
  SET DIAL PBX-EXCHANGE
  SET DIAL PBX-INSIDE-PREFIX
  SET DIAL PBX-OUTSIDE-PREFIX
  SET DIAL SUFFIX

ckuusr.h, ckuus[34].c, ckudia.c

Added automatic initialization of the following items from the corresponding
environment variables, if they are defined:

  K_COUNTRYCODE   DIAL COUNTRY-CODE        ; Local country code
  K_AREACODE      DIAL AREA-CODE           ; Local area code
  K_INTL_PREFIX   DIAL INTL-PREFIX         ; International dialing prefix
  K_LD_PREFIX     DIAL LD-PREFIX           ; Long-distance prefix
  K_PBX_EXCHANGE  DIAL PBX-EXCHANGE        ; PBX exchange
  K_PBX_INSIDE    DIAL PBX-INSIDE-PREFIX   ; PBX internal-call prefix
  K_PBX_OUTSIDE   DIAL PBX-OUTSIDE-PREFIX  ; PBX outside-line prefix

ckcmai.c, ckcker.h, ckudia.c, 30 Jul 95.

Implemented SET DIAL CONVERT-DIRECTORY { ASK, ON, OFF } -- what to do when
an old-style directory is encountered:
  ASK = Ask.
  ON  = Convert without asking.
  OFF = Don't convert.
Default is ASK.  ckuus6.c, 30 Jul 95.

Fixes from Jeff for ddcnv() to two places that could cause additional
memory rot.

Added dncnv() routine to convert portable-format telephone number based on
locale info.  Presently visible only from LOOKUP.  First cut, very rough.
30 Jul 95.

Added the code to call dncnv() when actually dialing.  ckuus6.c, 31 Jul 95.

Added code for DIAL CONFIRMATION.  When phone number is fetched from directory
then, the first time that Kermit is about to dial, if DIAL CONFIRM is ON,
Kermit asks the user "Is this number correct?".  If the user says "no", Kermit
asks them to type in a replacement, which is then remembered throughout the
current dialing cycle (i.e. the user is not reprompted for this number on
subsequent dial attempts).  ckuus6.c, 31 Jul 95.

If we pick up the country code or area code from the environment, set the
default long-distance and international prefixes just as we do when the
corresponding SET commands are given.  ckudia.c, 1 Aug 95.

Changed phone-number comparisons to ignore all non-digits in country code
and area code.  ckuus6.c, 1 Aug 95.

Fixed SET DIAL { AREA-CODE, COUNTRY-CODE } to accept only numerics.
ckuus6.c, 1 Aug 95.

Fixed dodial() to fail and print an error message if a portable ("+")
dialing directory entry was found but the local country or area code were
not defined.  ckuus6.c, 1 Aug 95.

Fixed BAD bug in mdmhup(), in which, under certain conditions, parity could be
restored from an unitialized variable, resulting in corrupted files if the
file sender announced in the init string that it had parity (&) but then did
not encode for it.  Discovered by Jeff.  ckudia.c, 2 Aug 95.

Broke out "get numeric date" function into a separate routine, zzndate().
ckuus4.c, 2 Aug 95.

Added code to strip 9 from beginning of a Finnish area code, but only until
12 Oct 96, at which time Finland changes to 0, with date comparison done
using zzndate().  ckuus6.c, 2 Aug 95.

Added code to handle PBX dialing: DIAL PBX-EXCHANGE, DIAL PBX-INSIDE-PREFIX,
and DIAL PBX-OUTSIDE-PREFIX.  3 Aug 95.

DIAL PREFIX was being prepended twice, once in dncvt() and again ckdial().
Removed from ckdial.  4 Aug 95.

Removed '-T' switch, changed '-P' switch to take an argument, which is
pointed to by the variable pipedata.

Moved SET DIAL DIR parsing to separate routine to allow parsing of other
types of directories.  ckuus3.c, 4 Aug 95.

Added SET NETWORK DIRECTORY command, just like SET DIAL DIRECTORY.  Added
display of network directories to SHOW NETWORK.  But it doesn't do anything
yet.  To be filled in later...  ckuus[34].c, 4 Aug 95.

Added area-code "0-stripping" for some more countries (Italy, Portugal, etc)
where it is known to be safe.  ckuus6.c, 5 Aug 95.

Added a new flag cktapi.  If it is nonzero, then dncvt() does not put any
kind of prefixes or suffixes on the phone number.  The flag would be set in
setlin() in ckuus7.c if the user SETs LINE to a TAPI device.  5 Aug 95.

Added SET TERM VIDEO-CHANGE command, as in MSK.  For Win95, this will be
disabled by default because WriteConsoleOutputAttributes() causes the
application to crash if the screen width is not 132 or the height is not
25, 43, or 50.  Users can ENABLE this feature after Microsoft fixes the bug.
ckuus7.c, 5 Aug 95.

Finished network directory, but only for TCP/IP.  Can fix it up later for
other network types.  SET NETWORK DIRECTORY [ filename [ filename [ ... ] ] ]
sets it/them up, SHOW NETWORK lists them.  5 Aug 95:

If you have one or more network directories, then SET HOST or TELNET looks in
the given director{y,ies} for the name and then substitutes the appropriate
network type, address, and other info.  Format of the directory is:

  ; Full-line comment
  entry-name  network-type  host-name-or-address  other-stuff  ; comment

In which the network type must uniquely match one of the SET NETWORK keywords
(so, e.g. "tcp" is OK as an abbreviation of "tcp/ip"), and other-stuff depends
on which type of network it is.  For TCP/IP entries:

  entry-name  tcp/ip  ip-name-or-address  socket  ; comment

in which the "socket" is optional and defaults to 23.  Otherwise, rules are
just like for dialing directory.  E.g. you can have multiple entries with the
same name, you can abbreviate names by the same rules, etc.  ckuus7.c,
4 Aug 95.

Still to do:
 . Design entries for other net types like DECnet & X.25
 . (X.25 can have LOTS of fields!)

Fixed bug in setlin() introduced Saturday, in which it failed to set SUCCESS
indicator when opening a serial device, and so SET LINE/PORT appeared to fail.
7 Aug 95.

Added autoanswer-on and -off fields to MDMINF struct.  Added SET and SHOW
commands.  ckuus3.c, ckudia.c.  7 Aug 95.

Added ANSWER [ n ] command.  Optional n is timeout, seconds, default 0 == no
timeout.  Just like DIAL except (a) there is no phone number, so we skip the
modem's dialing command, and (b) we feed the modem its autoanswer command,
such as ATS0=1.  This made "?" at top level overflow the screen, so I made
COMMENT into an invisible command, sigh.  ANSWER not tested.  ckuusr.c,
ckuus6.c, ckudia.c.  7 Aug 95.

When DIAL / LOOKUP builds up a list of numbers, they should be dialed
"cheapest first".  So prior to dialing, now we sort the numbers in the
following order:

  1. Internal PBX
  2. Local
  3. Unknown, literal (no "+")
  4. Long distance
  5. International

This is, of course, a rough ordering, because we don't know which
long-distance calls are cheaper than which others, and we don't know which
countries are close and which ones are far.  ckuus6.c, 8 Aug 95.

Removed &S0, &C1, &D2 from all modem init strings, except #ifdef OS2,
in which case all three of these were added.  In UNIX, VMS, etc, people
often have to use different settings for these items, but in OS/2, Windows,
etc, we can safely set them.  ckudia.c, 8 Aug 95.

Created symbol NEWDEFAULTS in ckcker.h.  If this symbol is defined, then:

 . RECEIVE PACKET-LENGTH is 4096 rather than 90
 . WINDOW is 20 rather than 1
 . BLOCK-CHECK is 3 rather than 1
 . FILE TYPE is BINARY rather than TEXT

Defined NEWDEFAULTS if OS2 is defined.  Tested by running Kermit without
any init file.  On an Ethernet connection, it transferred files at well over
100,000 cps.  ckcker.h, ckcmai.c, 8 Aug 95.

Made FILE DISPLAY FULLSCREEN the default for OS/2, etc.  ckuusx.c, 8 Aug 95.
Made FILE NAMES LITERAL the default for NT.  ckcmai.c, 8 Aug 95.

Fixed a bug in which SET MODEM TYPE NONE caused stray memory references in
initmdm().  ckuus3.c, 9 Aug 95.

Changed default DIAL RETRIES to 5, DIAL INTERVAL to 10.  9 Aug 95.

Filled in HELP text for DIAL, SET DIAL, SET MODEM.  ckuus2.c, 9 Aug 95.

Added +1 800 / 888 as a special "free" category to phone-number sort.
ckuus6.c, 9 Aug 95.

Added SET DIAL SORT { ON, OFF } to let user disable sorting.
ckuusr.h, ckuus3.c, ckuus6.c, 9 Aug 95.

Made new symbols OS2ORWIN32 (== OS2 for now since NT is defined only if OS2 is
also defined) and OS2ONLY (== OS2 but not NT) in ckcdeb.h, to simplify #ifdefs
in the C code.  9 Aug 95.

Made LOOKUP look in network directory(s) too.  ckuus6.c, 9 Aug 95.

Added [\v(dir)] to default prompt whenever NOSPL is not defined, except
on Macintosh.  Changed default prompt for NT.  Changed SET PROMPT to
restore the appropriate system-specific prompt when given with no argument.
ckuus3.c, ckuus5.c, 9 Aug 95.

Changed default command mask from 7 to 8 bits for OS/2 & friends.
ckucmd.c, 9 Aug 95.

Alpha.017, dated 8 Aug 95.  Tue Aug  8 21:10:25 1995.

Discovered \findex() and \frindex() were broken.  Fixed in ckindex(),
ckuus4.c, 11 Aug 95.

Fixed bug in Microcom modem dialing (missing "break;" in switch statement).
Also fixed arrangement of some #ifdefs.  ckudia.c, 12 Aug 95.

Added SET DIAL TOLL-FREE-AREA-CODE [ number [ number [ ... ] ] ].  This lets
users specify which calls are "free" and go to the top of the "cheapest-
first" sort order.  800 and 888 are set automatically if the user says SET
DIAL COUNTRY 1.  It is not set automatically for other country codes.
ckuus[346].c, 12 Aug 95.

Added SET DIAL TOLL-FREE-PREFIX <blah>.  If Kermit detects that a call is
toll-free then it uses this prefix instead of the normal long-distance prefix,
in case the user has specified an alternative ld-prefix, e.g. for charging
purposes, which probably won't work with toll-free calls.
ckuus[346].c, 12 Aug 95.

Changed DIAL command to treat numbers that are not found in the dialing
directory the same way as numbers that are found there, so user can type (e.g.)
"dial +1 (212) 555-1212" if she wants to, and have it converted in the normal
way.  ckuus6.c, 12 Aug 95.

Changed LOOKUP to set the redial string, so "LOOKUP blah, DIAL" will dial
blah.  Various other cleanups in dodial(), for example, so LOOKUP would work
on versions built without network support.  ckuus6.c, 12 Aug 95.

When DIAL RETRIES is > 0 but the number was not found in the directory,
then Ctrl-C did not break out of the retry loop.  Fixed in dodial(), ckuus6.c,
12 Aug 95.

Fixed -DNODIAL build... various #ifdef's needed juggling.  ckuus[347].c,
12 Aug 95.

Some fixes to various files from Jeff resulting from warnings from a new
compiler -- missing return statements in functions, etc.  12 Aug 95.

Added PDIAL command - "partial dial".  Just like DIAL, except it appends a
semicolon to the end of the phone number if the modem is Microcom or
Hayeslike; not supported otherwise.  This is useful with numbers fetched
from the dialing directory.  ckuusr.h, ckuus6.c, ckudia.c, 12 Aug 95.

Complications relating to PDIAL: Don't add ";" if there already is one,
otherwise modem errors out.  And then, if modem errors out, the phone is still
off hook, so Kermit has to hang it up.  And finally, break out of the DIAL
RETRIES loop if there is ANY kind of error when dialing and the previous dial
was partial.  Otherwise, we just keep retrying the second part of the number,
which does no good at all.  Also, don't record redial numbers for partial
dial, or the dial after a partial dial.  ckuus6.c, ckudia.c, 12 Aug 95.

Added initialization of dialing directory file name(s) from environment
variable K_DIAL_DIRECTORY, ckudia.c, 13 Aug 95.

Fixed phone-number processor to allow for dialing from countries, such as
Singapore, that do not have area codes.  ckuus6.c, 13 Aug 95.

Fixed phone-number processor to allow user to SET DIAL LD-PREFIX to
nothing to force (e.g.) 10-digit dialing in the USA & Canada.
ckuus6.c, 13 Aug 95.

Added SET DIAL TF-* as invisible synonyms for SET DIAL TOLL-FREE-*.
ckuus3.c, 13 Aug 95.

Added four new variables: 
  \v(d$ac) = DIAL AREA-CODE
  \v(d$cc) = DIAL COUNTRY-CODE
  \v(d$lp) = DIAL LD-PREFIX
  \v(d$ip) = DIAL INTL-PREFIX
ckuus4.c, ckuusr.h, 13 Aug 95.

Installed ld- and intl-prefix defaults for Finland.  ckudia.c, ckuus3.c,
13 Aug 95.

Made old modem-types visible in "set modem type ?" after all.  There's really
no reason to hide them.  Made "tapi" modem-type invisible.  Not clear yet if
we'll even need it.  ckudia.c, 13 Aug 95.

Added SET MODEM CAPABILITIES synonyms to match the display in SHOW MODEMS.
Also, discovered that SET MODEM CAPABILITIES never worked right.  Fixed it.
ckuus3.c, 13 Aug 95.

Updated help text.  ckuus2.c, 13 Aug 95.

Fixed Mwave init string to not contain two &S0's, which pushed it over
the length limit (noticed by Jeff).  ckudia.c, 13 Aug 95.

Alpha.018.

Fixed dial module to not fail if the phone rings during an ANSWER command.
ckudia.c, 14 Aug 95.

Added a couple more special cases for Finland and France changeovers.
ckuus3.c, ckuus6.c, ckudia.c, 14 Aug 95.

Changed VN_D$xxx to VN_D_xxx in ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, because $ can't be
used in preprocessor symbols.  14 Aug 95.  (and uploaded new sources etc)

Added SET PROTOCOL (and synonym SET TRANSFER PROTOCOL) to let user select an
external protocol, within #ifdefs.  This is designed, at present, only to work
with specific external protocol packages, not to be a general-purpose protocol
loader / shell.  ckcker.h, ckuusr.h, ckcmai.c, ckuus[r3].c, 14 Aug 95.  These
commands do nothing as yet.

Made SET EXIT WARNING ON the default for OS/2 & similar OS's.  ckuusr.c,
15 Aug 95.

Fixed server end of REMOTE QUERY to handle \f...() functions.  Now you can
use any of the following forms (but the first is recommended) to get info
from the server that involves calling functions:

  remote query kermit files(oofa.*)
or:
  remote query user \\ffiles(oofa.*)
or:
  remote assign oofa \\ffiles(oofa.*)
  remote query user oofa

ckcpro.w 5A(079), 16 Aug 95.

Moved "Warning - Prior SET DIAL COUNTRY-CODE required" message to the
right place.  17 Aug 95.

Changed command-line-option interpreter to accept "-j host service" as
well as "-j host:service".  This lets "kermit -c -j" be a synonym for
"telnet".  ckuusy.c, 19 Aug 95.

Added '-T' command-line option for text mode file transfer.
ckuusy.c, 8 Sep 95.

Fixed TELNET and SET HOST commands as follows: if a SET NETWORK DIRECTORY
command was given, but (one of) the named file(s) could not be opened, then,
even if the user had given a literal hostname or address, Kermit would refuse
to use it.  Now it simply ignores network-directory-file-open errors that
occur in this situation.  ckuus7.c, 9 Sep 95.

Similarly, fixed ludial() not to terminate fatally if it can't find a
dialing directory.  ckuus6.c, 9 Sep 95.

NOTE: This was the reason why in previous versions we kept the dialing
directory file open all the time.  If they could open it at the time that the
SET DIAL DIR command was given, even if it was a relative filename, and then
CD'd all over the place, they would not lose it.  Now they HAVE to give a
fully qualified filename, or else they won't be able to open after CD'ing.

Fixed ludial to allow exact matches, even if they are substrings of other
entries.  Previously, if "foo" and "foo2" were both in the directory, and the
user said "dial foo", Kermit would complain that "foo" was ambiguous; now it
works.  Requires a second pass, but this happens only when there is an
ambiguity.  ckuus6.c, 9 Sep 95.

Same deal for lunet.   ckuus7.c, 9 Sep 95.

When DIAL CONFIRMATION is on, allow user to skip a dialing the number by
entering an empty one.  ckuus6.c, 9 Sep 95.

Added SET COMMAND COLOR <fg> <bg>.  Just parses and sets variable
commandcolor, but doesn't actually do anything.  #ifdef OS2 only.
ckuus3.c, 9 Sep 95.

Filled in PRINT command for NT to be COPY /B filename xxx, where xxx is
the SET PRINTER device-or-filename, or if that is NULL, then "PRN".
ckuusr.c, ckuus3.c, ckufio.c, 9 Sep 95.

Added invisible BINARY and TEXT (ASCII) commands, equivalent to the
corresponding SET FILE TYPE commands.  ckuusr.[ch], 9 Sep 95.

A user complained that a certain macro wasn't working right in SunOS.
Turns out it was longer than the command-buffer length, CMDBL.  Changed
CMDBL (and also the atom-buffer length, ATMBL) to be governed by BIGBUFOK.
Defining BIGBUFOK at compile time means, in general, "memory to burn".
Added display of these buffer lengths to SHOW SCRIPTS.
ckcker.h, ckucmd.h, 9 Sep 95.  

Changed DIAL command to look up its target in the dialing directory only if
it starts with a letter.  This makes entry of literal phone numbers (starting
with digit or +, etc) much faster and less confusing.  ckuus6.c, 9 Sep 95.

Don't complain about lack of country-code definition when dialing a literal
number, but do complain about lack of country-code definition when dialing a
portable-format number, no matter whether it is from a dialing directory or
was typed in directly.  ckuus6.c, 9 Sep 95.

Do complain about lack of area-code definition when dialing a number within
one's own country, and one's own country has area codes, and does not allow
local numbers to be dialed the same way as long-distance.  For now, this is
effective only for country code 1, and it's only a warning.
ckuus6.c, 9 Sep 95.

Updated messages, help text, etc etc.  ckcmai.c, ckuus2.c, 9 Sep 95.

DIAL, TELNET, SET HOST now allow their targets to start with "=" (equal sign)
to indicate that the following text is to be used literally and not looked up
in any dialing or network directories, no matter whether they start with
letters or digits or anything else.  The "=" sign, of course, is stripped
first.  ckuus6.c, ckuus7.c, 9 Sep 95.

Added (invisible) CLS command for OS/2 & friends.  Untested.
ckuusr.c, 9 Sep 95.

Added ROBUST, CAUTIOUS, FAST as built-in macro definitions, which take into
account various compile-time options and buffer-size limits.
ckuus5.c, 9 Sep 95.

Changed default block check to 3, always.  No reason not to.
ckcker.h, 5 Sep 95.

Added SET DIAL CONNECT { ON, OFF, AUTO }, which tells whether to CONNECT
automatically after successful dialing.  AUTO means do so only if DIAL command
was given from top level, i.e. not from a macro or command file.
ckuus3.c, ckuusr.c, ckuusr.h, 9 Sep 95.

Added SET DIAL RESTRICTION { NONE, LOCAL, LONG-DISTANCE, INTERNATIONAL }
ckuus3.c, ckuus6.c, 9 Sep 95.

Added a new function, chkspkt(s), to ckcfn2.c.  It checks whether s is a
valid S packet; returns 1 if so, 0 if not.  10 Sep 95. 

SET COMMAND COLOR now works on systems that support it.  ckuus3.c, 10 Sep 95.

New function added by Jeff to ckufio.c: zfnfp(), which, given a filename,
returns a fully qualified filename.  10 Sep 95.

Autoreceive while in CONNECT mode for terminal-emulating versions.  10 Sep 95.

Multiprotocol structures...

Added SET PREFIXING { ALL, CAUTIOUS, MINIMAL, NONE }, as shorthands for
SET CONTROL PREFIX <lotsa-numbers>, and also to be used with other protocols.
10 Sep 95.

Added ^^ and ^\ and ^] (and 8-bit equivalents) to SET PREFIXING CAUTIOUS.
ckuus[35].c, 11 Sep 95.

Added initialization of prefixing to ckcmai.c at startup, before reading
init file.  11 Sep 95.

Added askmore() pagination to BUG command.  11 Sep 95.

Added SET AUTODOWNLOAD { ON, OFF }, within #ifdef CK_AUTODL..#endif.
CK_AUTODL should not be defined unless CK_APC is too.
ckuusr.h, ckuusr.c, ckuus3.c, 11 Sep 95.

Don't let user send multiple files with XMODEM.  Make user specify
a RECEIVE name with XMODEM.  ckuusr.c, 11 Sep 95.

Added SET FILE DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY.  Works with RECEIVE, GET, kermit -r,
and autodownload.  Lots of files.  14 Sep 95.

Prevented any Kermit-specific commands (GET, FIN, REMOTE, etc) from parsing
or executing if PROTOCOL is not KERMIT.  14 Sep 95.

Added SET LOGIN for OS/2 & pals.  14 Sep 95.

Updated HELP text.  15 Sep 95.

In OS2 & friends, replace SET DIAL (etc) DIRECTORY filename with fully
qualified filename.  ckuus3.c, 15 Sep 95.

Add code all over ckucmd.c to guard against overflow of atom buffer, e.g.
by long macro definitions.  15 Sep 95.

Added new DIAL items (RESTRICTION, CONNECT) to SHOW DIAL display.
ckuus4.c, 15 Sep 95.

Filled in zfnq..blah..() for UNIX, added to SET FILE DOWN and SET DIAL/NET
DIR, so even if user gives a relative pathname and then CDs to different
places, all of these still work.  15 Sep 95.

Cleaned up SHOW FILE, added download-directory to it.  ckuus4.c, 15 Sep 95.
Similary for SHOW PROTOCOL.

Added help text for recent commands, 16 Sep 95.

Fixed broken SET FILE DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY behavior, 16 Sep 95.

Added \v(download) and \v(protocol) variables.  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, 16 Sep 95.

Added a new command-parsing function, cmifip(), "parse an input file name
with a path", which is like cmifi(), except a path can be included, which is
used if the filename, as given by the user, is not found and is not absolute.
ckucmd.c 5A(074), 23 Sep 95.

Changed SET { DIAL, NETWORK } DIRECTORY command to use new input-file parsing
function appropriately.  ckuus3.c, 23 Sep 95.

Same thing for TAKE.  ckuusr.c 5A(166), 23 Sep 95.

Increased maximum number of dialing directory lookup hits from 1024 to 4096,
since we actually do have more than 1024 entries for some services (Tymnet,
CompuServe, ...).  ckuusr.h, 23 Sep 95.

Found & fixed a memory leak in DIAL.  ckuus6.c, 23 Sep 95.

Fixed a subtle problem with HANGUP when it was using modem commands.
ckudia.c  23 Sep 95.

Added a macro isWin95() to make checking easier and more consistent.
24 Sep 95.

Added commandline switch -W blah.

Added commandline switch -F telnetfd.

Fixes for Win32 DIAL and INPUT timeouts.  30 Sep 95.

Make C-K delete startup file by default if started from Dialer.  Added
invisible SET STARTUP-FILE { DISCARD, KEEP }.  30 Sep 95.

Added SET TERM ATTR-BUG { ON, OFF } for Win32, invisible, ON by default.
30 Sep 95.

Made SET TERM BYTE 8 automatically SET PARITY NONE.  30 Sep 95.

Fixed SET WINDOW & HELP SET WINDOW for ZMODEM.  30 Sep 95.

Added search-path capability to cmifip() so TAKE, SET DIAL DIR, etc,
can be set up to search multiple (not just one or two) directories for
the given file if it is not found as given.  This has a lot of possibilities
for the future -- e.g. we could add "set TAKE path blah;blah;blah..." so
user or site could specify any path at all.  Or so SETUP program could put
the right stuff in the INI file it constructs.  etc etc.  ckucmd.[ch],
4 Nov 95.

Added \v(instatus) variable to indicate result of most recent INPUT command.
Values:
 -1 = No INPUT command given yet
  0 = Succeeded
  1 = Timed out
  2 = Interrupted by user (keystroke or SIGINT)
  3 = Internal error
  4 = I/O error or connection lost
ckuusr.h, ckuus[r45].c, 13 Jan 96.

Added SET TEMP-DIRECTORY [ <text> ].  ckuusr.h, ckuus3.c.  13 Jan 96.

Added \v(tmpdir) variable.  Returns SET TEMP-DIRECTORY value or, if none set,
then the value of TEMP or TMP environment variable, if any, or (in UNIX only)
"/tmp/", with the appropriate directory separator always appended.  In OS/2,
etc, we change \ to /.  SHOW FILE displays this.  ckuus4.c.  13 Jan 96.

Script programs can use \v(tmpdir) to use or create a temporary directory.
They can also use the SET TEMP-DIR command to make \v(tmpdir) have the desired
value.  This way Kermit can be configured to create temporary files in any
desired location, which is handy (e.g.) when running Kermit off a file server.
13 Jan 96.

Added \fhexify(string) and \funhexify(hexstring).  14 Jan 96.

Added \fbreak(s1,c) and \fspan(s1,s2), as in Snobol.  17 Jan 96.

Added \ftrim(s1[,s2]) and \fltrim(s1[,s2]).  26 Jan 96.

Added RMDIR and UNDEFINE commands.  27 Jan 96.

Changed READ, ASK, ASKQ, and GETC to allow a macro name as well as
backslash-variable name as the target for storage of the input'd material.
ckuus*.c, 28 Jan 96.

Better testing for EOF vs i/o error in zinfill().  ckufio.c, 29 Jan 96.

Jeff added \v(exedir) and \v(inidir), and changed the meaning of
\v(startup) in the Win32 version.  30 Jan 96.

Fixed a bad bug in which Kermit was using -1 as an index into the
packet-buffer-struct array.  It had been there for years but was never
noticed till now.  Symptoms could vary wildly from system to system, from
nothing at all to a memory access violation, and anything in between.
The fix was to not reference the packet-buffer struct in this one place
if k < 0 (the same test was already made in all the other places, but this
one had been overlooked).  ckcfn2.c, 31 Jan 96.

One common and nonlethal symptom of the previous bug was a long delay in
responding to a GET, FINISH, or similar client command of the sort that begins
by sending an I packet to the server.  In this case the I/Y exchange is
regarded as a complete transaction, and the sending of the command (R, F, etc)
to the server begins a new transaction.  Yet tinit() (to initialize all the
data structures for a new transaction) was not being called at this point,
which was the cause for the -1 index noted above in the first place.  Now
tinit() is called in these (two) places.  ckcpro.w, 31 Jan 96.

Fail if ttopen() or ttpkt() fails in ckcpro.w.

Don't print new directory name if CD command given from a macro or command
file.  ckuus5.c, 1 Feb 96.

Fixed cmdir() to supply default value if given a variable name as an argument,
but the variable contained nothing.  ckucmd.c, 1 Feb 96.
(Should probably do this for other functions too...)

Jeff removed setjmps & longjmps from ckotio.c ttinl(), which were resulting in
tons of overhead on Win95, and were (on very fast network connection) causing
occasional deadlocks or crashes because of thread/timing considerations.
Result: Kermit transfers are about three times faster, and no more deadlocks
and crashes.  ckotio.c, 1 Feb 96.

File date code in zstime() and zfcdat() fixed to handle bad dates and not
follow null pointers returned by localtime().  ckufio.c, 1 Feb 96.

Fixed netopen() to handle null host->h_addr_list pointer so "set host 0" no
longer crashes K95 under OnNet-32.  ckcnet.c, 1 Feb 96.

Added \v(errno) and \v(errstring).  6 Feb 96.

Added \v(_line) to reflect line number from current command file, if any.
1-based: Line 1 is the first line, etc.  If the value of this variable is 0,
then there is no current command file.  Also added filename and line number
diagnostics to the command parser to aid in script debugging.  8 Feb 96.

Added \fcapitalize() - as in "Capitalize".  12 Feb 96.

Changed \function() parser to always evaluate arithmetic expressions
in numeric argument fields automatically, so that \feval() need not be
included by the caller -- e.g.:
  \fmod(3+4,5-2)
rather than:
  \fmod(\feval(3+4),\feval(5-2))
12 Feb 96.

Changed cmnum() to parse expressions.  So now users can use an expression
in most any numeric field.  There can be no embedded spaces in the expression.
Examples: "SET RETRY 10+6", or "SET RETRY (10+6)", "SET RETRY \%a+\v(time)",
but not "SET RETRY 10 + 6".  12 Feb 96.

Changed doif() to parse expressions in IF =, IF >, and IF < (ditto for XIF,
of course).  Same rules as for cmnum() -- no embedded spaces.  12 Feb 96.

FOR <variable> <initial> <final> <increment> { <command-list> }, changed to
evaluate the <initial> value as an expression.  The previous changes already
took care of <final> and <increment>.  Now expressions can be used directly
without \feval() in all fields of a FOR command, but with same rules about
imbedded spaces.  12 Feb 96.

Changed varval() to evaluate arithmetic expressions.  This allows INCREMENT
and DECREMENT to work on variables whose values are themselves arithmetic
expressions.  12 Feb 96.

Same treatment for IF NUMERIC.  This required setting a flag telling the
expression evaluator not to print error messages if given non-numeric
operands.  The flag is set only during evaluation of the IF NUMERIC quantity.
Hmm... on second thought, this isn't a good idea.  People usually want to know
if a string really does contain only numeric characters.  They can always use
\feval() if they want it to handle expressions.  Never mind.  12 Feb 96.

Added IF / WHILE { TRUE, FALSE }.  17 Feb 96.

Fixed references to \%0..9 variables in cmofi().  It handled all the other
kinds OK, but not those.

---(1.1.3)---

Added hundreds of casts to many modules to keep thickheaded fascist compilers
happy about signed vs unsigned chars, courtesy of William Bader.  24 Feb 96.

In PC version, allowed SET PRINTER to take a pipe as well as a file or device
as an argument.  This allows sending text through a filter before it goes to
the printer.  For example, in Windows 95, writing to PRN does not invoke any
kind of print driver, so sending text to a PostScript printer is an exercise
in futility.  Now you can send the text through a text-to-PostScript converter
like so:

  set printer |textps.exe>\dev\lpt1

Note: backslashes need (should) not be doubled.  To include spaces, enclose
in braces:

  set printer {| textps.exe > \dev\lpt1}

Textps is the program I wrote in 1991 to take care of the same situation on
DOS / Novell networks, and which also has been in service on Columbia's UNIX
servers since then, adapted to Windows 95/NT by Jeff.  It handles code-page to
PostScript character-set translation, etc etc.  This new scheme should also
fit nicely with any LPR clients that might be available, if any.  The only
requirement is that the program accept the text to be printed on standard
input.  24 Feb 96.

Added code to allow higher VMS serial speeds.  24 Feb 96.

If MYCURSES is defined, make sure that CK_WREFRESH is not defined.  ckuusx.c,
25 Feb 96.

Changed SET CARRIER to SET CARRIER-WATCH.  25 Feb 96.

Bug reported by John Nestoriak <telecon!barney!john@uu5.psi.com>, basically
that dialing again on a "set host..., set modem..., dial..." connection
(i.e. when using a terminal server to dial out from) did not work; therefore
neither did REDIAL on such connections.  Fixed in ckudia.c, ckuus4.c,
25 Feb 96.

Fixed reporting of TAKE-file line numbers; it wasn't resetting properly.
ckuus6.c.

Massive fixing of compiler errors involving misplaced #ifdefs, etc, found
while compiling (for the first time in six months) on many different
platforms:

  SPARC-10 SunOS 4.1.3
  HP-9000/712 HP-UX 9.05
  NeXT 68040
  VAXstation 3100 VMS 5.5-2 with and without UCX
  Alpha AXP VMS 6.1 with and without MultiNet

And also with various compile-time options: NOFRILLS, NODEBUG, NOPUSH, NODIAL,
MINIDIAL, NOCSETS, no TCP/IP, NOSPL, NOICP, NOLOCAL, NOHELP, NOJC, ...
25 Feb 96.

Discovered that the following script would write over C-Kermit's memory:

  assign \%a X
  assign \%n 0
  :loop
  assign \%a \%a\%a
  if fail stop 1 Stopped at n = \%n
  increment \%n	
  echo \%n
  goto loop

The problem was that ASSIGN (and DEFINE, etc) would never fail when they
detected that the definition was too long.  The symptom was that eventually
(e.g. when n reached about 60 -- i.e. \%a was supposedly 2^60 bytes long) that
the command parser would stop working -- "?No keywords match - "if""...
Fixed in dodef(), ckuus6.c, 26 Feb 96.

Allowed SET PROTOCOL and related features (SHOW PROTOCOL, \v(protocol),
HELP SET PROTOCOL, etc) to work even when XYZMODEM are not available, to
increase portability of scripts.  26 Feb 96.

Tentative SCO UNIX 3.2v5.0 changes within new CK_SCOV5 conditional, plus
accompanying makefile entries, courtesy of Robert Lipe.  26 Feb 96.

Changed Linux entry to use -lcurses (again) instead of -lncurses.
You can't win...  29 Feb 96.

Fixed entry for character 127 Finnish-to-Latin1 table.  ckuxla.c, 6 Mar 96.

--1.1.4--

Added { brace processing } to the DIAL command.  Otherwise, we'd have a
pretty tough time with DIAL strings that contain commas when used in macros.
ckuus6.c.  13 Mar 96.

Added dashless, commaless macro definitions.  Also FOR and WHILE loops, and
XIF.  Works for command files only (not at prompt).  New code is entirely in
the "get next command from TAKE file" routine, getnct(), in which:

 1. The brace counter is set to zero.
 2. A line is read from the command file.
 3. The trailing comment, if any, is stripped.
 4. If a line STARTS with a closing brace, the brace counter is decremented.
 5. If the line ENDS with an opening brace the brace counter is incremented.
 6. If the brace counter is 0 or the line ends with '-', it is continued.

Allowing for:

  DEFINE FOO {       ; Comment
    command 1        ; Comment
    command 2        ; Comment
    DEFINE BAR {     ; Comment
      command 1      ; Comment
      command 2      ; Comment
    }                ; Comment
  }                  ; Comment

and:

  FOR \%i 1 3 1 {    ; Comment
    FOR \%j 1 3 1 {  ; Comment
      ECHO \%i:\%j   ; Comment
    }                ; Comment
  }                  ; Comment

(similarly for WHILE) and:

  XIF <condition> {  ; Comment
    command 1        ; Comment
    command 2        ; Comment
  } ELSE {           ; Comment
    command 1        ; Comment
    command 2        ; Comment
  }                  ; Comment

These can be nested and combined to any level.

Details:

 1. The old way still works (explicit commas and hyphens).
 2. No comma is inserted after the opening brace.
 3. Commas are inserted after each line in a "begin block".

As a result of (3) the last line in a block has an extraneous comma after
it, but so what.  Same as C (but not Algol-60)...

This method of line continuation always results in comma insertion at the
line breaks, and so therefore should only be used with DEFINE, ASSIGN,
FOR, WHILE, and XIF, where the commas make sense.  Such things as:

  ECHO {
    Line 1
    Line 2
  }

will produce a result, but not necessarily the expected one.

When a LINE is very long (as opposed to a list of commands), of course it can
still be continued in the old way, even inside of a new-style {...} block.
Needs lots of testing.  ckuus5.c, 13 Mar 96.

Ditto for top-level.  cmini() and gtword(), ckucmd.c, 15 Mar 95.

Previous changes to getnct() broke dialing/network directory reading.
Fixed in ckuus5.c, 19 Mar 96.

Fixed both getnct() (TAKE file reader) and gtword() (for reading commnds
from keyboard) to accept blank lines within { ... } blocks.  19 Mar 96.

Reinstated Ctrl-L for PC version.  And Jeff added various screen-formatting
commands.  19 Mar 96.

Added a way to build up a list of files, in which each list element carries
a transfer mode and (if not wild) an optional as-name, in such a way that all
the files are sent in the same transaction (i.e. between one set of S and B
packets).  ckuusr.h, ckuusr.c, ckuus[2457].c, ckcfns.c, 20 Mar 96.  The new
commands are:

  ADD SEND-LIST <filespec> [ <mode> [ <as-name> ] ]
  SHOW SEND-LIST
  CLEAR SEND-LIST
  SEND

In the ADD command, the filespec can be for a single file or it can be wild.
If the <mode> is omitted, the current global mode (text or binary, etc) is
used.  If the <filespec> is not wild, an <as-name> can be included; if it is,
the file is sent under that name; otherwise it is sent under its own name.

The SEND command, when given with no operands at all, sends from the current
SEND list, if any.  If there is none, it prints an error message and fails.

ADD/SEND is different from MSEND in that it allows a mixture of text and binary
files in the same transaction, and that each file can have its own as-name.
Example:

  SET FILE TYPE TEXT
  ADD SEND-LIST ck*.h                 ; Transfer mode defaults to TEXT
  ADD SEND ck*.c text                 ; No as-name
  ADD SEND wart binary                ; Transfer mode forced to binary
  ADD SEND wermit binary
  ADD SEND makefile text ckuker.mak   ; As-name given
  SEND

The SEND-LIST stays put after the SEND command, in case you want to send it
again.  To display it, use SHOW SEND-LIST.  To get rid of it, use CLEAR
SEND-LIST.  Even when a SEND list is defined, you can still SEND files in the
regular ways, by specifying their name(s) in a SEND or MSEND command, etc.

The SEND list is intended mainly for use by programs or scripts that generate
file lists, although of course it can be used interactively too.  For example,
a program might build up a list of files and determine whether each one was
text or binary depending on some criterion best known to itself, such as
whether its name ended in ".EXE".

Changed default delay (SET DELAY) to be 1 second rather than 5.  ckcker.h,
21 Mar 96.

Changed FOR command to evaluate its loop variables only at loop entry, not
each time through the loop.  This was required in order to allow \v(argc) to
be used as a loop variable, or in a loop-variable expression.  Thus, we no
longer can have FOR loops that modify their own exit conditions by changing
the final value or the increment (as we can in C).  Hopefully nobody depends
on the old behavior, which is pretty atrocious anyway.  The problem with
\v(argc) is that it is on the macro stack; after entry into the _forx macro,
it is at the wrong level.  Now we can write a macro that echoes its arguments:

  def SHOWARGS {
    for \%i 0 \v(argc)-1 1 {
      asg \%x \\%\%i
      echo \%i. \%x
    }
  }

I also changed _GETARGS to copy the argc value along with the arguments
themselves.  This lets \v(argc) be referred to inside FOR, WHILE, and XIF
blocks, but this change did not affect the FOR loop variables themselves.
ckuus6.c, 21 Mar 96.

Changed cmnum() to accept quantities in braces, in which case it strips the
braces prior to evaluation.  ckucmd.c, 21 Mar 96.  This is beneficial for
FOR-loops especially:  FOR \%i {\v(argc) - 1} 1 { commands... }  -- previously
this would cause a parse error.  21 Mar 96.

Changed version number to 5B(192).  ckcmai.c, etc, 23 Mar 96.

Recoded cmres() to avoid triple assignment, which caused DEC C 5.2 to crash
if /DEBUG was on.  Thanks to Joellen Windsor.  ckucmd.c, 23 Mar 96.

While going through other modules, also recoded any double/triple/etc
assignments I came across.  (Let's all do this...)

Fixed NOPUSH to get confirmation, and fixed associated #ifdefs.
ckuusr.c, 23 Mar 96.

Set nopush = 1 if the environment variable CK_NOPUSH is defined.  ckhost(),
ckuusx.c, 23 Mar 96.

Changed network directory lookup to skip lookup if name starts with digit,
asterisk, or period.  ckuus6.c, 23 Mar 96.

Added \&_[0..10] as the argument vector for the current macro, if any.  It is
predeclared, and contains COPIES of the macro argument pointers, and it is
pushed and popped properly with the macro level.  ckuus[456].c, 23 Mar 96.
Previously, there was no good way to go through macro arguments
programmatically; now you can:

  for \%i 0 \v(argc)-1 1 { echo \%i. \&_[\%i] }

At some point since 5A(190) I broke cmifi() in a way that prevented it from
expanding variables -- this was part of the horrible stuff I had to do to
allow it to parse OS/2 (and now DOS / Windows) filenames without requiring the
user to type double backslashes.  Then later I fixed it.  But it turns out the
fix only worked for a variable name by itself (such as "type \%a"), but it
did not work for a string containing a mixture of literal characters and
variable names ("type foo\%a").  Fixed (not prettily) 23 Mar 96.

Fixed the OUTPUT command to treat backslashes just like ECHO does.  Previously
there was a bug in which any number of consecutive backslashes would be
treated as if there were only two, and would therefore be resolved into one.
Now two become one, four become two, etc.  ckuus5.c, 23 Mar 96.

Fixed AT&T DataPort modem entry to not send multiple A's in init-string and
to remove reference to S84 (AT commands "ignore error" switch), as these have
been removed in the newer models.  ckudia.c, 23 Mar 96.

Added Kermit protocol autodownload to UNIX CONNECT module.  ckucon.c,
23 Mar 96.

Integrated Jeff's code with mine -- Jeff added internal routines to generate
directory listings, file deletion replies, TYPE and WHO listings, etc, so as
not to have to use pipes, which don't work in Windows 95, for use by the
server in replying to REMOTE DIR, REMOTE DELETE, REMOTE TYPE, etc, commands.

Added local variables for macros.  Syntax:

  LOCAL name [ name [ name [ name [ name ... ] ] ] ]

If given inside a macro definition, makes the named variables local, meaning
that they hide the values of any global variables of the same name until the
macro exits, at which time the higher-level variables are restored.  The types
of variables that can be used as local variables are \%a..\%z and macros
(either macros to be executed, or macro names used as long variable names).
Nesting works to any level.  Example:

  define \%a TOP-LEVEL value   ; Global (top-level) value for \%a

  define XX {
    local \%a                  ; Declare a local variable with the same name
    define \%a XX value        ; Give it a different value
    echo \%a                   ; Display the value
    yy                         ; Execute another macro that changes it
    echo \%a                   ; See if it's the same
  }
  define YY {                  ; Second-level macro
    local \%a                  ; It has a local copy of \%a too
    define \%a YY value        ; Give it a unique value
    echo \%a                   ; Display it
  }
  echo \%a                     ; Display top-level \%a
  xx                           ; Do the xx macro (which does the yy macro)
  echo \%a                     ; See if it changed

You can also use array *elements* as local variables, but not entire arrays.
(No automatic arrays.)

Scope: If macro A invokes macro B, macro B inherits macro A's local variables;
it can read them and change them, or (of course) it can declare its own local
variables with the same names, which hide those of macro A.  ckuusr.[ch],
ckuus5.c, 24 Mar 96.  More about this later...

Hints: Don't put LOCAL commands in loops -- you should only execute the LOCAL
command once in each macro.  Don't declare \%0..\%9 as LOCAL unless you really
mean to wipe out the parameters that were passed to the macro.

Added designer banner for SCO OpenServer R5.  ckuver.h, 24 Mar 96.

Fixed snddir() to work for VMS (*.*) and AOS/VS (+).  ckcfns.c, 24 Mar 96.

Changed name of linger() routine to ck_linger, since it used a struct which
is also called linger, and some compilers (e.g. HP-UX 7.05) couldn't take it.
ckcnet.c, 24 Mar 96.

Fixed INCREMENT / DECREMENT to allow macro names too:
  define foo 1, increment foo, echo \m(foo)
produces the desired result.  ckuus[56].c, 24 Mar 96.

Note, however, the second INCREMENT field can't be a macro name unless it
is derefrenced via \m(...), because it is parsed by cmnum():

  INCREMENT foo \m(bar)

not:

  INCREMENT foo bar

Added nopush runtime test to VMS CONNECT module.  ckvcon.c, 24 Mar 96.

Added binary-mode negotiation support to VMS CONNECT module.
ckvcon.c, 24 Mar 96.

Added autodownload to VMS CONNECT module.  Works whether TERM APC ON or OFF;
works even if TERM CHAR == 7-bit NRC (unlike K95).  ckvcon.c, 24 Mar 96.

The hard part about the autodownload code is finding the right place to put
it.  The right place is: after it reads a character from the port and applies
the "set terminal bytesize" mask to it, but BEFORE any translation is done.
The other hard part is that each of the ck*con.c modules works differently --
some with forks, some with threads, some ... etc, so "doing" the autodownload
is different in each case.

Changed Jeff's dotype() command to be buffered and to make allowances for
Macintosh and VMS.  25 Mar 96.

Added support for Gateway Telepath II 28.8 modem.  ckudia.c, 25 Mar 96.

Added changes from Phil Keegstra to make NLCHAR a variable rather than a
hardwired compile-time symbol.  This is governs the line terminator for local
files: LF, CR, or CRLF.  The variable is now feol.  If 0, it's CRLF, if
nonzero, it's the nonzero value (e.g. 10 or 13).  These changes do not affect
how the program works at all, but they do include a bit of code in some
versions that was previously #ifdef'd out.  ckcker.h, ckcfns.c, ckcmai.c,
ckufio.c, 25 Mar 96.

Added SET FILE EOL command to let the user change the line terminator.  The
choices are presently CR, CRLF, and LF.  The default is appropropriate for
each system (UNIX, Mac, OS-9, OS/2, VMS etc).  SHOW FILE displays the value.
This allows a file to be sent in text mode even if it has the wrong line
terminator for the local system -- e.g. a UNIX-format text file on an OS/2
system, or a Mac-format file on VMS, etc.  ckuus4.c, ckuus5.c, 25 Mar 96.

Added external protocol support for XMODEM, YMODEM, YMODEM-g, and ZMODEM:

If C-K is built with -DCK_XYZ it has protocol selections of Kermit, Zmodem,
Ymodem, Ymodem-g, and Xmodem.  In the OS/2 and Windows versions, the XYZ
protocols are internal.  In other versions they are external and the user
must define the associated commands; in any case, this feature is available
only in implementations that support CK_REDIR (the REDIRECT command).

  set protocol <name> [ <autouploadcmd> [ <sendcmd> [ <rcvcmd> ] ] ]

If command stops after <name>, the protocol is selected but nothing else
is changed.

The remaining fields are commands that apply to the given protocol.  They work
like this:

The <autouploadcmd> is the command to send to the host when commencing an
upload, for example "rz" when sending with Zmodem.

The last two commands, <sendcmd> and <rcvcmd>, are only for use with external
protocols.

If a <...cmd> is given, it replaces the previous one, if any.  To include a
command that has embedded spaces, enclose it in { braces }.  To erase a
command, use {} (empty braces).

If you specify one command, you must specify all three, otherwise the trailing
ones will be erased.

Each of these commands may include "%s" (percent sign followed by lowercase s)
which will be substituted by the filename(s) in your SEND or RECEIVE command.
Example:

  set protocol zmodem rz {sz %s} rz
  set protocol xmodem {rx %s} {sx %x} {rx %s}
  set protocol zmodem {} {sz %s} rz

The defaults are:

  set protocol zmodem {} {sz %s} rz
  set protocol ymodem {} {sb %s} rb
  set protocol ymodem-g {} {sb %s} rb
  set protocol xmodem {} {sx %x} {rx %s}
  set protocol kermit {}

Since Kermit does not understand the syntax of external protocol programs
there is no way for it to modify the external commands automatically to make
their options agree with Kermit's own (e.g. text vs binary mode, send vs
resend).  However, since you, the user, understand the syntax of your external
protocol, it should not be difficult for you to write macros to do this;
e.g. for Zmodem:

  def sz {
    local \%p \%t
    asg \%p \v(protocol)               ; Save current protocol
    if = \v(ftype) text asg \%t -a     ; sz text-mode option
    set proto zmodem rz {sz \%t %s} rz ; Choose zmodem in text or binary mode
    send \%1                           ; Send the file
    asg \%t \v(status)                 ; Save file-transfer status
    set proto \%p                      ; Restore protocol
    end \%t                            ; Return file-transfer status
  }

Warning: when used in conjunction with Add, there is no way to accommodate
mixed text/binary mode transfers when using external protocols.

Another note: If you want to use a protocol other than the ones listed, just
lie about its name and define the appropriate commands.

Many modules, 25 Mar 96.

Tested external protocol feature under SunOS in both local and remote mode
with sz/rz -- Works fine in remote mode (no surprise).  In local mode (of
course) transfers fail over Telnet connections because sz has no idea that it
is a Telnet connection and so it must do special things with 0xff and 0x0d
characters.  Escaping control characters ("sz -e") doesn't help because that
only affects data, not control fields.  If it had a command-line switch that
told it to double IACs and turn CRs into CRLFs, it would work fine on Telnet
connections.  (Exercise for the reader who has rz/sz source code: add this
feature :-)  It does work fine, however, on regular serial (dialout or dialin)
connections, given proper transparency and flow control.  26 Mar 96.

Added default definition for CK_XYZ (external protocol support) to UNIX
builds.  ckcdeb.h, 26 Mar 96.

Changed PPI modem definition because S82 (BREAK handling) disappeared in
newer models and causes modem to report ERROR.  ckudia.c, 26 Mar 96.

Changed Multitech modem definition in numerous ways suggested by Glenn
Thobe <thobe@lafn.org>.  Also installed Glenn's fixes relating to modem
software flow control.  ckudia.c, 26 Mar 96.

Discovered that filenames given on the command line that contained wildcard
characters were not expanded in UNIX.  That was because I was afraid that
if a file called "*" actually existed and somebody tried to send it, it would
start off a neverending frenzy of recursion and the universe would explode.
I found a simple way around this and have removed the restriction.  ckcfns.c,
26 Mar 96.

Added a KERMIT command, which takes as arguments any command-line options that
C-Kermit can take on the command line.  So if somebody is at the C-Kermit
prompt and accidentally types "kermit -s oofa.*", it will work.  More to the
point, if they have a communication program that sends "kermit -r" as an
"autoupload command" prior to uploading files, it will work whether C-Kermit
has been started or not.  The only gotcha (that I noticed) regards grouping --
different shells use different notation for grouping -- e.g. doublequotes in
UNIX -- but Kermit uses matching sets of { braces }.  ckuusy.c, 26 Mar 96.

Added a last-minute check in the command parser for OS/2 and Windows -- if a
top-level keyword parse fails and the command buffer contains <letter>:,
perhaps followed by a directory name, then treat that as a CD command.
ckucmd.c, ckuus5.c, 26 Mar 96.

Merged in Jeff's change to ckcnet.c -- if a Windows user tries to open a
TCP/IP connection to a numeric IP address (usually because of some problem
with DNS), it takes forever to resolve the address.  This doesn't happen on
other OS's, but the Windows version of gethostbyname() evidently still tries
to contact DNS -- the very problem the poor user was trying to avoid by using
an address rather than a name.  Now the Windows version first checks to see if
it is an address (by calling inet_addr(), which is not necessarily available
elsewhere), and if so skips the call to gethostbyname().  26 Mar 96.

Changed CKERMIT.INI to new syntax and generally updated for version 5B.
Renamed LOOKUP macro (for services directory) to FIND.  27 Mar 96.

Changed the packet input timer from fixed to dynamic, using standard
statistical techniques and adapting code from Tim Kientzle's Dr Dobbs article.
The SET SEND TIMEOUT value is now the *initial* value; subsequent values are
calculated dynamically based on a weighted average & standard deviation.
The user can enable or disable this feature with a trailing field to
SET SEND TIMEOUT <n> [ { DYNAMIC, FIXED } ] (default is DYNAMIC).
ckcmai.c, ckcfn[s23].c, ckuus[47].c, 27 Mar 96.

Fixed SHOW VAR for \v(m_xxx) modem strings to show control characters
graphically.  ckuus5.c, 27 Mar 96.

Added text/binary mode distinctions for external protocols:

 SET PROTO <name> [ ab at sb st rb rt ]

b = binary, t = text; a = autoupload, s = send, r = receive.
ckcmai.c, ckcpro.w, ckuus[r234].c, 28 Mar 96.

Changed all #ifdef OS2 concerning XYZMODEM protocol to #ifdef XYZ_INTERNAL,
so now XYZMODEM can be supported in all C-Kermit versions as either internal
or external protocols.  ckcmai.c, ckcpro.w, ckuus[r234].c, 28 Mar 96.

Added CHECK XYZMODEM command.  ckuus3.c, 28 Mar 96.

Changed UNIX connect module to also support ZMODEM autodownload.
ckucon.c, 28 Mar 96.

Added appropriate definitions for XYZ_INTERNAL and CK_TIMERS to ckcdeb.h.
In particular, the programmer can safely assume that if XYZ_INTERNAL is
defined, then so is CK_XYZ.  Both of these are defined by default for OS2.
28 Mar 96.

Filled in some help text, SHOW FEATURES display, etc.  ckuus[25].c, 28 Mar 96.

Changed designation from Beta back to Alpha.  Too shaky to be called Beta
when we put it up for the C-Kermit testers...  ckcmai.c, 28 Mar 96.

New CKVKER.MMS from Mike Freeman.  28 Mar 96.

Added Communication Toolbox support to Mac Kermit ckm*.* modules, from
Rick Watson at U of Texas.  28 Mar 96.

Added -J command-line option, similar to -j, but causes C-Kermit to exit when
the connection is closed, but still allows escaping back & forth while it is
open.  New flag variable is tn_exit.  #ifdefs might need fixing up.  ckuusy.c,
ckcmai.c, ckuus4.c, 29 Mar 96.

Consolidation of repetitive code in setproto().  29 Mar 96.

Massive fixes to ckudia.c and ckuscr.c, and minor fixes elsewhere, for the
Macintosh, to allow for the fact that Macintosh signal handlers are long,
not void and not int, plus accounting for many other changes that have been
made since 1984.  Remember to always declare signal handlers as SIGTYP, not
VOID or anything else, and to use SIGRETURN to exit from them, rather than
"return" or nothing at all (on the assumption they are void).  29 Mar 96.

Fixed remaining problems in Macintosh build -- added ckusig.c to makefile,
added bait-and-switch defs for alarm and signal to it, added dummy zfcdat() to
ckmfio.c (maybe somebody will fill it in).  But it crashes at runtime...  Sent
mail to Rick Watson asking for help.  1 Apr 96.

From Jeff:

 . Support for XYZMODEM as an internal protocol in UNIX version.
 . Default autoupload strings defined for each protocol.
 . zxpand() and znext() for NT redone to use system services rather
   than traversing directory -- faster, and allows many more matches.
 . Internalized local DELETE and TYPE commands for OS/2 & Win95.
 . Integrate XYZMODEM with ADD SEND-LIST, MSEND, etc.

Fixed the OUTPUT command *again*.  This was much harder than it looked.  It
was a REALLY BAD idea to let \N, \B, \L be special for this command, because
there is practically no way to reconcile these with the regular prefixing
rules.  To work around, I stooped to some pretty disgusting byte-stuffing
tricks that seem to make it possible to keep the advertised syntax, yet still
allow strings such as "\N0" to be OUTPUT (e.g. to modems for which this is a
command), and still permit expansion of variables such as \%a.  It was the
OUTPUT'ing of backslashes, and in particular multiple backslashes and strings
like "\N0", that had been broken up till now.  There are still some minor
glitches, such as "output \\%a = \%a" interprets \%a in both places instead
of only the second one.  ckuus[r5].c, 2 Apr 96.

Also fixed OUTPUT \N, \B, and \L to work in remote mode.  Previously
they called tt..() routines rather than con..() routines.  2 Apr 96.

Jeff added SHOW KEY { ONE, ALL }, 3 Apr 96.

Jeff fixed bug with K95 Dialer that prevented PBX's from working, 3 Apr 96.

Fixed OUTPUT to not do anything fancy if COMMAND QUOTING OFF -- i.e. to send
its argument literally -- backslash is just another character.  3 Apr 96.

Added SET [ FILE ] DESTINATION { DISK, PRINTER, SCREEN } for compatibility
with MS-DOS Kermit.  Destination is displayed in SHOW FILE.  ckcker.h,
ckuusr.h, ckuus[r347].c, 3 Apr 96.

Added SET PRINTER to UNIX and other versions, as in OS/2, etc.  However, it
will have no effect in VMS, VOS, etc, until zprint() functions in ck*fio.c
are updated to use it.  NOTE: In Windows and VMS, a filename is used as the
printer (PRN, LPT:).  In UNIX, there is a distinction between a filename and
a pipe -- in UNIX a pipe must be used to run a program; if a pipe is not
given, the value is regarded as a filename.  So:

  set printer |lpr            ; Uses the lpr program for printing.
  set printer {| lpr -Pblah}  ; Ditto, with options (braces needed for spaces)
  set printer foo.x           ; A file
  set printer                 ; Restore default value

Fixed PRINT to actually work in non-OS/2 versions -- the arguments to
zprint() were reversed.  ckuusr.c, 3 Apr 96.

Changed PRINT and all other print operations to use the SET PRINTER value, if
any, otherwise to use the default printer.  In UNIX, if it is a file,
successive PRINT commands append to it.  Ditto for incoming files with the
PRINT attribute or if DESTINATION is SET to PRINTER.  zprint(), ckufio.c,
3 Apr 96.

All of this printer stuff needs looking at in OS/2, Windows, etc.

Started work on redirection of text received in response to a REMOTE
command.  Syntax is simply "> file" at the end of any REMOTE command:

  remote blah blah [ > file ]      (write to file)

or:

  remote blah blah [ | command ]   (pipe to command)

or:

  remote blah blah [ | command > file ]

(The parsing of this part is done, but not the action -- ckuus7.c.)

This is complicated, however, by the fact that the REMOTE HOST command
itself may contain or end with redirection or pipe indications, so new
syntax is needed to indicate "which end" it applies to:

  remote host blah blah [ > file ]             This end
  remote host { blah blah } [ > file ]         This end
  remote host { blah blah > file }             That end
  remote host { blah blah > file } > file      Both ends

Jeff changed exit warning on network connections to make some additional
checks whether the connection was still open before issuing the warning.
ckuus3.c, 4 Apr 96.

A no-longer-used #pragma was removed from ckcnet.c, and cautionary words added
to ckcplm.doc.  Sometimes you can't even protect these things with #ifdefs.
(It was for the 16-bit OS/2 version, which is no longer being developed.)
4 Apr 96.

More work on REMOTE command redirection.  File redirection (">") works,
but I didn't do the pipe yet.  "> filename" at the end of any remote command
puts its output into the named file.  The REMOTE HOST command also accepts
special notation to "bind" a redirection directive to the desired end:

  remote host blah blah > file      <-- Output goes in local file
  remote host { blah blah > file }  <-- Output goes in remote file

ckuus7.c, ckcpro.w, 4 Apr 96.

Added append capability to REMOTE output redirection:

  remote blah >> file               <-- Output is appended to local file

ckcpro.w, ckcfn3.c, ckuus7.c, 5 Apr 96.

Added pipe capability to REMOTE output redirection:

  remote blah | sort                <-- Output is fed to sort program
  remote blah | sort > file         <-- and from there to a file

This depends on the underlying zxcmd() function working.  ckcpro.w, 5 Apr 96.

(Now that all this work is done, how hard could it be to implement receiving
to a pipe or sending from a pipe??? -- it's mainly just a matter of designing
and parsing the commands for it...)

Fixed GETOK not to put answer (yes, no) in command recall buffer.  ckuus6.c,
6 Apr 96.

Placed an upper bound of (timint * 3) on the dynamically calculated packet
timeout, to prevent ridiculously long values.  ckcfn2.c, 6 Apr 96.

Broke up some long switch() statements in ckuus3.c, because they caused the
AT&T 6300 compiler to generate assembly code that caused a hash table overflow
in the assembler.  ckuus3.c, 6 Apr 96.

Fixed a series of typos in settrm() that prevented SET TERM CHAR PORTUGUESE
from working.  FC_DECMCS was included in the various lists of 7-bit character
sets, when it shouldn't have been, and FC_POASCII was omitted from the same
lists.  ckuus7.c, 6 Apr 96.

Fixed a problem with full-line comments in the command-file reader.  I also
decided that it was stupid to allow comments to be continued.  So now comments
take precedence over continuation marks.  This makes it easy to comment out
macro definitions that contained continued lines.  But this uncovered another
problem, namely that if the first line in a block was a full-line comment,
then the opening brace would be counted again, and so the block would never be
terminated.  Fixed by keeping a record of the last non-comment, non-whitespace
character in the line we just read, rather than the last such character in
the target buffer.  getnct() in ckuus5.c, 6 Apr 96.

Made "e" be an abbreviation for EXIT.  Previously, for some reason I don't
understand, "e" by itself was taken to mean "e-packet".  ckuusr.c, 6 Apr 96.

Added a match-string argument to kwdhelp() and had cmkey() call it instead of
building its own list.  So now we fit keyword lists more compactly on the
screen AND we get more-prompting if they don't all fit on one screen.  This is
timely because the top-level keyword help had become too big for a regular 24
by 80 screen.  ckucmd.c, ckuus3.c, 6 Apr 96.

Now that we have more space on the top-level "?" screen, I un-invisible'd some
commands that were previously invisible because they wouldn't fit: COMMENT,
KERMIT, MKDIR, RMDIR.  ckuusr.c, 7 Apr 96.

Made a new filhelp() function and had cmifi() call it.  Now long filenames are
no longer truncated because of column width (but they still are truncated at
the screen width), column widths are optimal, and we get "more?" prompting if
the list doesn't fit on the screen, and we also get a file list even when "?"
is typed as the first character in the field.  AND... the names are now
alphabetized (rather than shown in "inode" order) via shell sort -- bubble
sort too slow for large directories, qsort overkill.  Put code for old way of
making keyword and file menus into #ifdef OLDHELP..#endif, so the new size
should not be much different.  ckucmd.c, 7 Apr 96.

Changed mtchs[] array in ckufio.c to be dynamically allocated rather than
static, as in OS-9 version.  This should probably also be done everywhere
else.  Increased the size, SSPACE, of the static string space buffer for
filenames to 32K for systems when BIGBUFOK defined.  A small definition for
SSPACE is what was causing those "?Too many files match" errors.  It's not
enough to increase MAXWLD; SSPACE needs to be increased too.
ckufio.c, 7 Apr 96.

The trick that let us give shell commands like !command (without a space
between the ! and the command) was broken when the secret NOPUSH command was
added.  Fixed, ckuus5.c, 7 Apr 96.

Added "speed-buffering on" and "off" fields to the MDMINF structure and began
filling these in for the various modem types.  However, it's not clear what we
could ever do with them.  Most modems don't have an explicit command for this
-- it's usually tied to whether an error-corrected link was negotiated, and so
happens (or not) automatically.  Some do have a command, and when it is
distinct from other commands (e.g. error correction enable/disable), I stuck
it in.  But I didn't finish, and I don't use this field for anything, nor is
it tied into the user interface at all.  So for now it's just a place-holder.
ckcker.h, ckudia.c, 7 Apr 96.

Fixed bug in lookup() that prevented it from realizing when a keyword was
ambiguous.  This bug was introduced when lookup() was made case-independent
recently, to accommodate keyword tables formed at runtime that might contain
mixed-case items.  Also fixed xlookup() (like lookup, but requiring full
match) to be case-independent.  ckucmd.c, 8 Apr 96.

Added \v(xversion), the numeric product-specific version number, e.g. 115
for K-95, since these tend to change more quickly than the C-Kermit edit
number (e.g. 192).  It's just 0 for regular (UNIX, VMS, etc) C-Kermit.
Also added \v(packetlen) and \v(window).  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, 8 Apr 96.

Fixed a bug with TAKE-file line numbers being mixed up with dialing
directory line numbers.  ckuus[56].c, 8 Apr 96.

"command | kermit -s -" was broken; used to work in 190.  For some reason, at
some point, I started checking standard output (1) for ttyness, rather than
standard input (0), and of course that's wrong.  But I seem to remember there
was some important reason for doing this, but it's not in my notes, so I put
it back to 0, now it works.  ckuusy.c.  8 Apr 96.

Noticed that dialing-directory conversion doesn't handle multi-word entries
right -- it drops the braces; e.g. "{Long Island}" becomes "Long Island".
Fixing this would be too hard.  Add to "beware" file.

Jeff fixed a session-log bug in Win/OS2 version, introduced when the INPUT
command was routed thru the terminal emulator.  Items processed by INPUT would
be recorded twice.  Also it seems some writes to the session log were
unbuffered, others were buffered.  Now all are unbuffered.  9 Apr 96.

A printf() argument was missing in ddcvt() (dialing directory converter),
noticed by Paul Kimoto.  ckuus3.c, 10 Apr 96.

Added SET INPUT BUFFER-LENGTH <bytes> and made the INPUT buffer be dynamically
allocated rather than static.  This is needed for REINPUT, in case the items
that we are looking for are so widely separated that they do not fit into the
regular 256-byte buffer.  ckuusr.[ch], ckuus[2457].c, 11 Apr 96.

Apr 10-13: Built on:
 SunOS 4.1.3, full, and with many KFLAGS=-DNOblah.
 NeXTSTEP 3.0.
 Macintosh with Mac OS.
 PC with Unixware 2.03.
 VAXstation 3100 VAX/VMS 5.5-1 with and without UCX.
 MicroVAX-II VMS 5.4-2 + TGV MultiNet.
 Alpha AXP VMS 6.1 with and without TGV MultiNet.
 HP 9000/712 with HP-UX 9.05.
 DEC 5800 with Ultrix 4.3.
 IBM Power Power Series 400 AIX 4.1.
 Data General MV 2500/DC AOS/VS II 2.20.00.39.
 PC with QNX-32 4.22.
 PC with QNX-16 4.22.
 SCO OpenServer 5.0.

And in the process, corrected many, many, many #ifdef problems.

Discovered that everybody has a different idea about the data type of option
argument to getsockopt() and setsockopt(), and so made a C-Kermit data type
for it, SOCKOPT_T, defined in ckcnet.c in a sea of #ifdefs.  13 Apr 96.

Defined RDCHK for SCO OpenServer 5.0, since it has it, and without it we were
getting the old System-V-style "type the CONNECT-mode escape character
followed by X, Z, ...  to interrupt a file transfer".  First I tried SELECT,
since the man pages say it's there, but then I got all kinds of horrible
errors about tv and tz, etc, in ckutio.c.  So maybe it's some "other" kind of
select().  Anyway, it builds OK with -DRDCHK, but rdchk() does not seem to
work -- i.e. it doesn't read key presses while the file transfer display is
going.  Tried CK_POLL and it behaved just like RDCHK.  Then I remembered --
SCO header files have always defined FIONREAD, and it has never worked.  So I
replicated the #ifdef XENIX workaround for #ifdef CK_SCOV5.  But then with
FIONREAD out of the way, it turns out there is no rdchk() after all.  So then
I put back CK_POLL, since poll() is supposed to be part of SVR4.  And it
works, phew.  makefile, ckutio.c, 13 Apr 96.

Changed references to zattr struct member "access" to "_access" in all
remaining ck*fio.c modules (after having changed in ckcdeb.h + ck[uvmd]fio.c.
This was necessary to avoid some kind of compiler error, I forget where.
13 Apr 96.

Discovered that the auto-upload string didn't work at all -- the #ifdefs
around it were wrong.  Fixed, 13 Apr 96, ckcpro.w.  Now I have to build all
the versions over again, except SCO...

In tracking down reports of DIAL-related core dumps in Linux, it looks as if
there was one spot in ludial() where makestr() was being called with the wrong
level of indirection.  Also added additional malloc/free bulletproofing in
places where it had been missing.  ckuus6.c, 14 Apr 95.

At Linus Torvalds' recommendation, replaced curses with ncurses in the Linux
link step.  makefile, 14 Apr 96.  There are some other Linux issues still
outstanding, mainly how to set high serial speeds.  Some people are supposed
to get back to me with new code for this.

protofield(), the SET PROTOCOL field parser, was forgetting to return a value
at the end.  Fixed in ckuus3.c, 14 Apr 96.

Built all the aforementioned versions again and announced to the C-Kermit
testers group.  14 Apr 96.

Changed #ifdefs defining SOCKOPT_T to allow overriding from cc command line.
Most reports coming in say that the type is int everywhere except SCO OS5.
ckcnet.c.  Also, updated ckcker.upd and ckcker.nr, and reannounced to group.
15 Apr 96.

Removed an unnecessary variable (and call to makestr()) from the dialing
code in ckuus6.c, and changed makestr() itself to be VERY CAREFUL about
anomalous cases, like when the two pointers point to the same place, or to
overlapping places.  This might have been causing some memory rot & core
dumps.  ckcmai.c.  16 Apr 96.

In building on IRIX 5.3, found that some network-directory-related variables
were multiply declared (nh_p and nh_p2 in ckuus7 and ckuusy); changed the
ckuusy ones.  17 Apr 96.

Simplified the #ifdefs around SOCKOPT_T since it seems that only one system
(Unixware) was using anything other than int.  ckcnet.c, 17 Apr 96.

Fixed a typo in the built-in definition for the FAST macro.  ckuus5.c,
17 Apr 96.

SET SEND TIMEOUT <n> { FIXED, DYNAMIC } parsing had default & help string
reversed.  ckuus7.c, 17 Apr 96.

Discovered that I had never actually activated the dynamic round-trip timers.
All the ttinl() calls in rpack() were still using the old variable, not the
new one.  Fixed in ckcfns.c, 17 Apr 96.

Added RTT/Timeout (Round Trip Timer / Timeout) field to fullscreen file
transfer display.  ckuusx.c, 17 Apr 96.

Added code to time how long it takes to send a packet (works only on SunOS for
now).  The result is shown in the debug log.  It seems that sending a 4K
packet on a congested Internet connection can take up to 60 seconds, or
longer.  ckutio.c, ckcfn2.c, 19 Apr 96.

SET EXIT WARNING ALWAYS...

Found and fixed a memory leak in new ?-help routines for keyword and file
lists, ckucmd.c, 22 Apr 96.

Found and fixed a memory leak in new local-variable code.  ckuus5.c, 23 Apr 96.

Some code that should have been #ifdef'd OLDHELP was still being executed.
Added #ifdef OLDHELP to all code that referenced the old "hlptxt" buffer, etc.
ckucmd.c, 23 Apr 96.

Discovered that expression evaluator can accept numbers in different radices,
indicated by a trailing letter: "h" or "x" for hex, "o" or "q" for octal, "t"
for binary...

Found and fixed another problem with malloc() and free(), this one in the
command-recall code in ckucmd.c, 23 Apr 96.  Pretty embarrassing -- when
moving the command window up, the wrong loop counter was being used.

Wrote a new function tod2sec(string), which takes a string of the form
hh:mm:ss and converts it to a long, representing the number of seconds from
now.  If hh:mm:ss is less than now, then it is assumed to be tomorrow.
This function is now called by PAUSE, SLEEP, WAIT, etc, to allow time-of-day
format arguments, like MS-DOS Kermit.  ckuus6.c, 23 Apr 96.

Added \ftod2secs(hh:mm:ss) so users can call this function too.
ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, 23 Apr 96.

Added parsing for SET SERVER GET-PATH.  User can list up to 32 directories
for the GET path.  Same parsing mechanism and syntax as SET DIAL DIRECTORY,
except using directory names rather than filenames.  The appropriate
directory separator is appended to any names that do not end in a directory
separator.  ckuusr.h, ckuus3.c, 23 Apr 96.  Example:

  SET SERVER GET-PATH /usr/olga/ ~olaf /tmp

results in:

  /usr/olga/
  /usr/olaf/  (assuming olaf's login directory is /usr/olaf)
  /tmp/

Added display of GET-PATH to SHOW SERVER.  ckuus5.c, 23 Apr 96.

Added implementation of GET-PATH to gnfile() ("get next file").  If a SERVER
GET-PATH is set, then it, and only it, is used.  Thus, if you also want Kermit
to look in its current directory when a GET-PATH is in effect, the current
directory must be included in the GET-PATH.  If the client sends an absolute
(fully qualified) pathname, that takes precedence over the GET-PATH.  If it
sends a relative pathname (or simply a filename), then the directories in
the GET-PATH are searched, in the order given, and the file is sent from the
first directory in which it is found; if it is not found in any of them, a
"File not found" error message is sent.  Takes precedence over DISABLE CD.
ckcfns.c, 23 Apr 96.

Jeff discovered that the shell-expansion routines had a couple off-by-one
errors that might have resulted in bad memory references, and fixed them.
ckufio.c, 23 Apr 96.

Added the following Compose-key sequences:

 '.  or  .'   Apostrophe
 ^^           Circumflex
 ``           Grave
 ~~           Tilde
 ,. or .,     Comma
 ""           Doublequote
 ::           Diaeresis

This is because Windows 95 does not deliver dead-key sequences to console
applications, and so there is no way for people to type characters that are
used to form dead-key combinations unless there is a compose sequence for
them.  ckoco3.c, 24 Apr 96.

Added in lots more malloc/free bulletproofing from Jeff, many modules,
24 Apr 96.

Changed -J command-line option to also CONNECT automatically.  ckuusy.c,
24 Apr 96.

Added hh:mm:ss parsing capability to INPUT command.  ckuusr.c, 24 Apr 96.

Added DATE command -- just prints the current date and time.
ckuusr.[ch], 24 Apr 96.

Changed kwdhelp() not to print a gratuitous blank line at the end of the
list, and adjusted calls to it to print their own blank line if they needed
to.  ckucmd.c, ckuus5.c, 24 Apr 96.

Added protocol name to fullscreen file transfer display #ifdef XYZ_INTERNAL.
ckuusx.c, 24 Apr 96.

Discovered a subtle problem in the macro processor, namely if an XIF, FOR, or
WHILE statement had too many commands (i.e. too many commas), it would get
truncated early (i.e. after the 6th comma).  The symptom would be that parsing
would break down at some point after that because of an extraneous closing
parenthesis...  This problem was introduced when I added the code to allow
{ grouping } within function arguments, and is easily demonstrated with a loop
like this:

  for \%i 1 3 1 {
      echo \%i 1
      echo \%i 2
      echo \%i 3
      echo \%i 4
      echo \%i 5
      echo \%i 6
      echo \%i 7
      echo \%i 8
      echo \%i 9
  }

This will break in any C-Kermit version from 25 June 1995 until now, including
all versions of K-95.  Now it works -- fixed in zzstring() in ckuus4.c,
25 Apr 96.

Replaced all references to FSPECL with FILENAMLEN (which happens to be
longer).  Otherwise we're likely to lose lots of stuff when copying filenames
or file lists to \v(fspec).  25 Apr 96.

Changed UNIX and OS/2 versions to send back fully qualified filename in
ACK to F packet, instead of just the bare or relative filename.  ckcpro.w,
25 Apr 96.

Added hh:mm:ss notation to SET ALARM too.  ckuus3.c, 25 Apr 96.

Increased maximum number of elements in GET path to 128 if BIGBUFOK defined.
Also cleaned up some misplaced #ifdefs in ckuusr.h.  26 Apr 96.

Changed SHOW FEATURES to show the values of a lot of items that were not shown
before -- command buffer size, maximum number of macros, etc etc.  But the
display got too big for a normal screen, so I had to add line-counting and
askmore() prompting.  ckuus5.c, 26 Apr 96.

Added new command SET COMMAND MORE-PROMPTING { ON, OFF }. (default)
or disables askmore()'s more-prompting.  People who run C-Kermit in a window
that has scroll bars might prefer to use the scroll bars to hitting the space
bar at the end of each screenful of output.  ckuusr.h, ckuus[rx3].c,
26 Apr 96.

Also enabled SET COMMAND { HEIGHT, WIDTH } for all versions.  Outside of
#ifdef OS2, it simply sets the cmd_rows and cmd_cols variables to whatever the
user says.  These are used by askmore(), kwdhelp(), filhelp(), prtopt(), and
maybe other display routines.  ckuus[35].c, 26 Apr 96.

Added the above items to SHOW COMMAND and to HELP SET COMMAND.  ckuus[25].c,
26 Apr 96.

Updated and reorganized ckccfg.doc, added info about firewalls, etc.
27 Apr 96.

Copied tcpsrv_open() from ckonet.c to ckcnet.c and adapted it to UNIX, within
#ifndef NOLISTEN..#endif.  Now you can "set host * <socket>" on UNIX and wait
for incoming connections.  No login, no security, just runs in the user and
file space of whoever is running it.  This is all fairly system-independent,
since it depends only on the sockets library.  Adding authentication, login,
access control, etc, is different for every system -- UNIX, VMS, AOS/VS, VOS,
etc, and is likely to open up all sorts of security issues.  This version so
far compiled OK on SunOS and VMS/UCX.  27 Apr 96.

Initial observations -- a file transfer speedup of about 91%, by elimination
of the Telnet server and PTY driver.  This is on UNIX, using the same host,
software, connection, and settings in both cases (30 x 9000 packets, minimal
prefixing, flow none), transferring a 2MB text file.  Through a Telnet server,
the rate was 107000 cps, direct to socket it was 204000 cps.  But ftp is
still about twice as fast.

Problems: Server times out every 10 seconds or so, even though SERVER TIMEOUT
is 0.  And if you hang up on the server, it gets a "broken pipe" error, and
then starts getting timeouts -- and sending NAKs -- like mad.

Added SET SERVER LOGIN command, and accompanying code in protocol module to
enforce it.  There is no password file -- only one (or zero) userid/password
can be enabled at a time.  Also, there is no protection against the password
echoing (although I could add it easily), no encryption, etc.  It's just like
MS-DOS Kermit.  Logins and logouts are logged in the transaction log.
No doubt there are still a few loose ends here...  27 Apr 96.

Changed main C-Kermit version number to 6.0.192.  Enough has changed...
Also this marks the end of the old DEC-20 style version numbers.

Fixed i/o routines in ckutio.c -- myfillbuf(), myread(), ttinl(), etc, to pass
up proper return codes when network connection is broken.  Now "set host *"
server pops back to prompt if client hangs up.  This way, user can run a
script like "while true { set host * 2000, server }".

However, ttyfd is still > -1 and Kermit thinks the connection is still open.
Extensive tests on SunOS show that under these conditions, no system calls
return any kind of error: ioctl(ttyfd,FIONREAD,&foo) succeeds (but says zero
chars are available); read(ttyfd,1,buf) returns 0; in both cases, errno is set
to zero.  So the system does not tell us "connection reset by peer".  So in
the UNIX version of ttinl(), I added a check: if the read() returns 0 and it's
a network connection AND the timeout was 0 (as it is in server command wait),
it must be a closed connection, so it is safe to close our end too, thus
setting ttyfd to -1 and making everything else work as expected.  However,
this does not catch a hangup during a file transfer.  So I tried removing the
"timeout == 0" condition, reasoning that a network read that did not time out
would never return(0).  This did the trick on SunOS, but it might cause
problems on System V platforms where we have nonblocking reads.  Let's
try... (hours later...)  On UnixWare 2.03, after a lot of finagling, it's OK.
The crucial point is that incoming connections won't work without select(), so
if SELECT is not defined, then NOLISTEN is automatically defined too.  So now
we've compiled and executing this code on SunOS (BSD), UnixWare (System V),
and VMS (UCX).  ckcnet.c, 28 Aug 96.  Later, twiddled #ifdefs further to get
it compiled under AIX 4.1.  Changed AIX 4.1 makefile entry to define SELECT;
made a new entry for UnixWare 2.xx to include SELECT.  Compiled ok on AOS/VS
too (but no incoming TCP).

Increased size of communications i/o buffer from 256 to 4096 in UNIX version
if BIGBUFOK defined.  But it doesn't seem to affect performance.  204Kcps is
still top speed here (unloaded SPARC-20, internal socket connection).
28 Apr 96.

Added code to getrtt() and tinit() to take server command wait into account.
Now, no more timeouts during server command wait unless user asks for them.
ckcfn[s2].c, 28 Apr 96.

Fixed a bad bug introduced by SET SERVER GET-PATH, namely that I broke the
dialing and network directories by always tacking a directory separator on the
end of the filename, whereas that should only be done when parsing actual
directory names, not filenames.  ckuus3.c, 28 Apr 96.

I was going to try testing whether carrier drop in the middle of file transfer
popped C-Kermit back to the prompt automatically (if CARRIER-WATCH not OFF),
and if not to add code to ttinl() to take care of this, similar to the network
case, but I can't get dialtone on my phone line...

Added the "x_ifnum" hack around cmnum() for SET KEY CLEAR to prevent all those
scary messages from coming out of the expression parser.  Noticed by Max.
ckuus3.c, 28 Apr 96.

Eliminated some spurious entries from the transaction log that occurred when
an error packet was sent by the server in response to a command that wasn't
accepted.  ckcfn[23].c, 29 Apr 96.

Fixed a nasty bug in which, if a user Ctrl-C'd out of an ASK, DIAL, or similar
command that temporarily turns command quoting off, command quoting (including
recognition of question marks and backslashes) was not turned back on.  This
was not a simple matter of just turning it back on in the Ctrl-C handler, but
remembering the value of the user's most recent SET COMMAND QUOTING command,
and restoring it to that value.  ckuus[3x].c.

Added a SWITCH statement, almost just like in C.  Can be nested, etc.
ckuusr.[ch], ckuus[256].c, described in ckcker.upd, 29 Apr 96.

Discovered a stupid oversight that has been there for years.  If you
say "kermit filename", where filename is a relative filename (of a command
file you want Kermit to execute), but your initialization file contains a
CD command, Kermit can't find the file, because it will have changed its
default directory by the time it looks for it.  Fixed my moving some code
from main() to prescan() in ckuus4.c, and changing strcpy() to zfnqfp()
(convert filename to fully-qualified (absolute) filename).  1 May 96.

Changed version herald for K95, K2, and Mac to only show platform-specific
version number, and changed VERSION and SHOW VERSION commands to show both
version numbers.  1 May 96.

Fixed a problem with yesterday's command-file edit, which caused K95 to delete
its startup file before it executed it.  2 May 96.

Fixed another problem with answer mode in ckudia.c, which prevented certain
kinds of modems from answering the phone by erroneously setting S7 to the
ANSWER timeout (which by default is 0).  2 May 96.

Added -M command-line option for "My Username" (U and N already taken).
6 May 96.

Changed Solaris 2.x to use -DSELECT instead of -DCK_POLL.  10 May 96.

Added support for Bell Labs Research UNIX v10 (Tenth Edition), circa 1989, an
example of which lingers on at Auburn University, on a MicroVAX II, 10 May 96:

 . I imported my working source files, which are some weeks ahead of anything
   that is publicly visible.
 . I added a "bellv10" makefile entry, uses BSD4, defines BELLV10.
 . It uses <ndir.h> for directory structure so I added -DNDIR.
 . <sys/ioctl.h> doesn't exist so I added -DNOSYSIOCTLH.
 . get/setre(ug)id() are not available, so I added -DNOSETREU.
 . Includes <utsname.h> rather than <sys/utsname.h> - edited ckuusx.c.
 . No gethostname() - edited ckuusx.c.
 . Needs <timeb.h> instead of <time.h> - edited ckutio.c.
 . select() has its own unique calling conventions - edited ckutio.c.
 . BSD/V7-style <sgtty.h> is present and is used because of -DBSD4.
 . But instead of using gtty() and stty() it must use ioctl() with
   TIOCGETP and TIOCSETP, because there is no gtty() or stty().  This was
   discovered from reading "man ttyld".
 . At this point it compiles and links without complaint; size = 623909 bytes.
 . It runs too, but output is slow and jerky.    
 . Added -DNOSETBUF -DDYNAMIC and rebuilt.  Now it runs nicely.
 . Trying to add -DCK_CURSES and "LIBS=-lcurses" turns up a lot of unresolved
   references at link time, so no curses.
 . There's no sockets library or header files so I could not build in any
   TCP/IP support or Telnet client.  Somebody would have to implement the
   long-abandoned AT&T TCP/IP streams interface for this to work.
 . Couldn't make job control work but that was because the only shell
   available was /bin/sh, which doesn't handle it.  Add -DNOJC if needed.
 . I didn't do anything about setuid / setgid installation, UUCP lockfiles...

Added protection against trying to include the TCP linger() code in HP-UX
7.x, where SO_LINGER is defined in the header files, but the underlying
socket calls are not there.  ckcnet.c, 10 May 96.

Added SET TERM ESCAPE-CHARACTER { ENABLED, DISABLED }.  This allows a totally
transparent connection, at the expense of not being able to escape back by
typing ordinary ASCII characters like ^\C.  Of course users of Windows and
OS/2 can still get back using Alt-key combinations.  Users of UNIX, VMS, etc,
won't be able to get back at all except by having the other side drop the
connection.  Intended primarily for use when C-Kermit is "in the middle" and
must provide a totally transparent link, e.g. for XMODEM transfers.
ckuusr.h, ckuus[257].c, ck[uvd]con.c, 11 May 96.

Changed fullscreen file transfer display to show the number of window slots
NEGOTIATED rather than the number the user had set as the second number in the
"Window slots: x of y" display.  ckuusx.c, 11 May 96.

Changed struct zattr member _access to xaccess to avoid conflicts with 
access() function.  ckcdeb.h, ckcfn3.c, ck*fio.c, 11 May 96.

Broke up setprm() in ckuus3.c AGAIN in an attempt to overcome hash table
overflows when building on the AT&T 6300.  11 May 96.

Changed VMS znewn() to explicitly add 1 to the file version number, or else
to append ";0" to the filename if it has no version number.
ckvfio.c, 11 May 96.

Added zfnqfp() (get fully qualified filename) to VMS version.  Changed
#ifdefs around all references to it to #ifdef ZFNQFP.  ckcdeb.h, ckvfio.c,
ckcpro.w, ckuus[347].c, ckcplm.doc, 11 May 96.

Fixed dialing directory conversion in VMS to make a new version of the file
and then to actually use the new version.  ckuus6.c, 11 May 96.

Countless adjustments to #ifdefs and declarations to allow building with
various features deselected.  All modules.  11 May 96.

Figured out how to use select() in AOS/VS, added SELECT/DEFINE to AOS/VS build
procedure, and modified the appropriate modules to include the needed header
files and to use select() for input buffer peeking and for incoming TCP/IP
connections.  This should, for the first time, enable sliding windows.
ckdcc.cli, ckcnet.c, ckdtio.c.  Unfortunately, although the whole thing
compiles and links OK with SELECT defined, but it doesn't work right; select()
always returns -1; SLEEP and MSLEEP return immediately, in_chk always fails,
etc.  Put everything back as it was before, still works.  11 May 96.

Renamed setlogin() routine to cklogin() due to clash with a prototype in 
<unistd.h> on BSDI 2.0.  ckuus3.c, 11 May 96.

Converted IRIX 5.x and 6.x from using poll() to select().  Now TCP/IP
transfers are WAY faster.  makefile, 11 May 96.

------ announced 6.0.192 Alpha 0.20 --------

Unified UnixWare 1.x and 2.x makefile entries -- both versions now use
select().  makefile, 12 May 96.

Added -DSELECT for SCO V5.  There are evidently two classes of systems
in this area -- the ones in which one must pick up select()-related items
from <sys/types.h>, and the other ones where we must also include
<sys/select.h> -- but <sys/select.h> usually does not exist on the first
type of system, so once again: #ifdef city.  12 May 96.

Rearranged the SELECT-related #ifdefs to make sure they come after
the <sys/type.h> and <sys/time.h> (or equivalent) #ifdefs.  Before doing
this it would not build on Linux.  12 May 96.

Made a last-minute fix to the Bell V10 version -- select() was not working
right when used for millisecond sleeps, and FIONREAD was not defined -- fixed
by pulling in a nonstandard header file, <sys/filio.h>.  12 May 96.

------ uploaded 6.0.192 Alpha 0.20 again but dated May 12 --------

Got it working on SunLINK X.25 (version unknown), Solaris 2.4.  Had to fix a
lot of stuff -- this code hadn't been compiled or tested in 18 months...
Note: In order run this version, you need a Solaris system with the same
SunLink X.25 version (8.00?), AND you must have an environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH that includes the library where libsockx25 is, which is
usually /opt/SUNWconn/lib.  ckcnet.c, ckucon.c, ckuus7.c.  12 May 96.

------ uploaded 6.0.192 Alpha 0.20 again still dated May 12 --------

Changed AIX 3.2 makefile entries to omit -DCK_POLL.  This way they pull in
select() automatically, since they have -DSVR4.  (Thanks to Jamie Watson.)
makefile, 13 May 96.

Changed -DCK_POLL to -DSELECT in all sco32v4 entries upon advice of SCO
experts panel.  makefile, ckutio.c, 13 May 96.

Fixed Solaris 2.4/X.25 version to contain a link to the X.25 dynamic library
so the user does not need to have any environment variables defined in order
to run it.  Thanks to Xander Jansen.  makefile, 13 May 96.

Using C-Kermit to transfer itself over a very congested and bursty Internet
connection between NYC and Holland revealed some weaknesses in the file
transfer display -- now it reports all sorts of errors specifically ("Bad
header, timeout, bad sequence number, checksum error", etc), and the error
count is more accurate.  Also I realized while trying to use this connection
that the start-of-packet character should never be unprefixed unless the user
specifically requests it, so now "set prefixing minimal" does not unprefix it.
Now the same transfers work very nicely.  ckcmai.c, ckuusx.c, ckcfn2.c,
13 May 96.

Fixed a really bad bug in zfnqfp(), discovered by Bo Johansson
<bo.johansson@mbox2.swipnet.se>, where a ++ in loop should have been a -- (!).
ckufio.c, 13 May 96.

And another really bad bug, also discovered by Bo J, which broke the INPUT
command (the timeout interval was ignored).  ckuusr.c, 13 May 96.

---- (uploaded Alpha.021, 8:30pm, 13 May) -----

Oops, there was a typo in setalarm() ckuus3.c, left brace moved to the wrong
place.  Nobody could compile...  14 May 96.

---- (uploaded Alpha.021 again, 10:55am, 14 May) -----

And another really bad bug, also discovered by Bo J, in which the freelocal()
function was freeing the wrong node.  ckuus5.c, 14 May 96.

---- (uploaded Alpha.022, 10:55am, 14 May) -----

Finally got the select() business right for AIX 3.x, thanks to Nelson Beebe
and Jamie Watson -- needed to include <sys/select.h> after all.  Discovered
locally that this was also needed for AIX 4.1.  ckutio.c, 14 May 96.  

So then I decided it was stupid to try to hardwire all of this into the source
code, so now the decision to include <sys/select.h> is made in the makefile,
by including -DSELECT_H among the CFLAGS.  This is presently done for AIX 3.x
and above, SCO OS5, QNX, and COHERENT.  ckutio.c, ckcnet.c, makefile,
14 May 96.

Added prototypes for a bunch of recent functions that didn't have them.
ckcker.h, ckuusr.h, 14 May 96.

Added -i to Solaris makes.  Otherwise if I have LD_LIBRARY_PATH defined when
I build it, every user has to have LD_LIBRARY_PATH defined to the same thing
to run it.  makefile, 14 May 96.

Checked on Digital UNIX 3.2, Solaris 2.5, Solaris 2.4, HP-UX 9.05, AIX 4.1,
NeXTSTEP 3.1, ...

---- (uploaded Alpha.023, 8:30pm, 14 May) -----

Fixes for Digital UNIX 3.2 UUCP lockfiles from Jamie Watson.  ckutio.c,
makefile, 15 May 96.

Archaeology: Bell V10 again...  Discovered MYREAD wasn't defined for
nonblocking buffered reads -- defined it (because FIONREAD is available).
Added debugging material to ttsspd(), since it is failing for some reason.
Later, determined that it has a unique set of ioctls and structs for
getting/setting speed, not documented in any man page, but buried in
<sys/ttyio.h>.  Recoded all BELLV10 material in ckutio.c to use struct ttydevb
and TIOC[SG]DEV ioctls for getting/setting speed.  All of this evidently also
applies to UNIX V8 and V9, but who really knows.  15 May 96.

Moved BIGBUFOK definition to ckcdeb.h, where it can also be seen by
ck*[tf]io.c, etc.  15 May 96.

Chuck Fuller noticed that the sequence ?, help <anything>, ? would result
in the command-screen width changing.  Turns out to be a typo in the HELP
command, fixed in ckuus2.c, 16 May 96.

Made SET TERM AUTODOWNLOAD OFF the default for UNIX, VMS, etc -- i.e. the
versions of Kermit that don't have a real terminal emulator.  It's not good
to change defaults like this in a product that people have been using for
years.  Plus the UNIX/VMS/etc versions are very likely to be used "in the
middle", where we this feature would only be a nasty surpise.  It remains
enabled by default in Windows and OS/2.  ckcmai.c, 16 May 96.

At Vince Fatica's suggestion, added \v(dialresult), which contains the
literal result code from the modem in response to a DIAL, REDIAL, or ANSWER
command, like "CONNECT 2400", "NO CARRIER", "CONNECT 57600/LAPM", etc.
ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, ckudia.c, 16 May 96.

Also added some more dial status codes:

  30 = Blacklisted
  31 = Delayed
  32 = Fax connection

Also added a lot more "knowledge" to the numeric-dial-result-code interpreter,
since anything above about 10 or 11 is totally nonstandard; added specific
cases for high-speed Hayes models, PPI, AT&T Dataport, Microcom Deskporte,
Rockwell, Boca, Gateway Telepath, Zoltrix, Multitech, ...  ckudia.c, 16 May 96.

Changed Linux makefile entry to include TCP/IP and -DLINUXFSSTND, suggested by
Kurt Klingbeil, blessed by Linus.  Made a separate entry if they want to build
without TCP/IP.  Updated comments.  makefile, 17 May 96.

Added numeric result codes for Intel modems.  ckudia.c, 17 May 96.

Based on experience transferring big files between NYC and the Czech Republic
and the Netherlands via very unpredictable Internet connections, added small
refinements to packet reading code: in input(), if we are about to give up
because of too many retries, first call ttchk() to see if anything is waiting
to be read -- in that case, go read it instead of giving up.  And...  since
the round-trip timer calculation was only done when a packet was successfully
received, we would tend to error out on timeouts once we got the first
timeout.  Now, if we get a timeout or other error, we bump up the timeout
interval.  It's still not perfect, though, because we also want to avoid the
situation in which we time out while in the middle of reading a perfectly good
packet.  But the alarm()/signal()/setjmp()/longjmp() structure of ttinl()
makes it almost impossible to handle that one.  18 May 96.

---- (uploaded Beta.025, 19 May 96) -----

Fixed setting of \v(inidir) to (a) not use strrchr(), which is not portable,
and (b) account for non-UNIX directory separators.  ckuus5.c, 21 May 96.

Added missing network-directory material to ckermit.ini.  22 May 96.

Fixed resetting of line numbers when reading network directory and SET TAKE
ECHO is ON.  ckuus7.c, 22 May 96.

Fixed network directory to work for X.25.  It was tacking ":23" (TCP Telnet
port number) onto the X.25 address, and it wasn't setting "nettype" from
the directory entry.  ckuus7.c, 22 May 96.

Added "Trying <address>..." message for X.25 connections, just like IP
connections.  ckcnet.c, 23 May 96.

Changed SET NETWORK to have only two keywords: DIRECTORY and TYPE, and then
listed network types after TYPE.  But let the old form still be accepted,
invisibly.  ckuusr.h, ckuus3.c, etc, 23 May 96.

Jeff fixed a bug introduced by me in May 22 changes, that broke rlogin.
setlin(), ckuus7.c, 24 May 96.

I fixed a related bug: if you gave a SET HOST command with a name that was
succesfully looked up in the network directory, followed by a TELNET command
with a name or address that was not in the network directory, the wrong
address (and perhaps also net type) would be used.  lunet(), setlin(),
ckuus7.c, 24 May 96.

Discovered, not sure what to do about it: "telnet 0 13" on Solaris (but not,
for example, on SunOS) makes Kermit dump core -- only happens if a port number
is given; "telnet 0" by itself works fine.  Also, it seems to happen only when
the remote closes the connection -- the connection seems to be made and used
fine...  The same thing happens with "telnet localhost 13" and "telnet
127.0.0.1 13", so it's not the 0.  It's not the port, either, because if I
specify a different host, same, port, no problem.  See solaris-telnet-0.log.

Later...  Discovered the same thing happens on SunOS -- it has nothing to do
with host "0" -- it happens if I start Kermit with the regular init file,
etc, and then "set host blah 13".  Must be something to do with reading
networks directory...

In setlin() and lunet(), ckuus7.c, 27-28 May 95:

 . Almost completely rewrote setlin(), an 800-line function...
 . Fixed lunet() not to assume TCP -- i.e. don't assume anything about
    what fields 4 thru end are.
 . Added network directory fields for X.25.
 . Let additional data (port, etc) in command override what's in directory
 . Add username field for TCP (to be used by rlogin)
 . Add support for K_NET_DIRECTORY environment variable, as for dial directory
 . Fixed LOOKUP to work if there is a net directory but not a dialing directory
 . Fixed SET HOST * to not always use port 1649
 . Added password field for SuperLAT
 . Fixed core dumps (???)

Core dumps aren't really fixed.  Maybe 1 time in 1000 the scenario noted above
will still produce a core dump, so there is still some memory rot somewhere.

Made SET LOGIN available to all versions, not just #ifdef OS2.  29 May 96.

Found and fixed another memory leak.  The problem was in popclvl(), where it
was restoring the macro argument vector.  When popping back to top level, the
code (which dates from Mar 25) was accessing m_arg[-1][i].  This would happen
every time a macro was executed, and would happen during execution of the
standard init file.  Cure: don't do it.  Thanks to the AIX compiler runtime
checking features (see new rs6aix41d makefile entry) for making it stop in the
right place, rather than thousands of instructions later.  ckuus5.c,
29 May 96.

But we still got core dumps on SunOS when TELNETing to TCP port 13, which
prints a short date-time string and then closes the connection.  Diagnosis:
The connection was closed before the CONNECT code had time to set its longjmp
buffer, but the interrupt handler was trying to take the longjmp anyway.
Solution: Set Yet Another Global Flag saying whether the setjmp() had been
executed yet, check it before taking the longjmp.  ckucon.c, 29 May 96.

Fixed RLOGIN to work in UNIX.  But you still need to be root to use it.
Ditto for VMS.  ckcnet.c, ckvtio.c, 30 May 96.

Fix "kermit -J host 513 -M user" so it makes an Rlogin connection.
ckuusy.c, 30 May 96.

Added "microlink" modem type for German MicroLink 14.4/28.8/2440 modem models,
from manuals sent by Peter Eichhorn.  Also added support for DIAL LOCKED
message required by law in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.  Untested.
ckudia.c, 30 May 96.

Many fixes to DIAL display suggested by Peter Eichhorn:
 . Display results of lookup, e.g. "oo" expands to "oofa", "not found", etc.
 . If lookup was ambiguous, print message and don't dial.
 . If number starts with =, print message and don't look up.
 . Don't display "Opening..." message twice.
 . Line up the messages better.
ckudia.c, ckuus6.c, 30 May 96.

Added \v(dialnumber), ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, 31 May 96.

Fixed spurious "REDIRECT capability required" message that came out after
a Kermit autodownload in C-Kermits that did not have redirect capability.
ckuus3.c, 31 May 96.

Added makefile entry for Sequent DYNIX/ptx 4.1, from Tom Kloos.  31 May 95.

Added #define for SO_OOBINLINE (0x0100) if not defined in header files.
Needed for HP-UX 7.00, hopefully nowhere else.  ckcnet.c, 31 May 96.

Changed -DSELECT back to -DCK_POLL in sco32v4 and sco32v4gcc entries, because
SELECT also requires gettimeofday(), which is in libsocket.a, which is
available only on SCO 3.2v4 systems that also have the TCP/IP developers kit.
Kept -DESELECT in all the sco32v4*net* entries, as well as the ODT and
SCO V5 entries.  makefile, 31 May 96.

Fixed TYPE command, which now uses internal file i/o routines rather than
calling the system, to save the file type, set the file type to text, type
the file, then restore the file type.  dotype(), ckuus6.c, 31 May 96.

Clarence Dold noticed that when built with MINIDIAL, dialing didn't work when
he used "set modem type hayes" for his Intel modem.  Diagnosis: the basic
Hayes modem types did not have a "wake_prompt" defined (as "OK<CR>"), whereas
the more advanced versions did.  Supplied the missing wake_prompt strings.
ckudia.c, 31 May 96.

SET FILE DOWNLOAD DIRECTORY wasn't working in VMS because zfnqfp() was
erroneously appending .; to the end of the directory name.  Not knowing how
to tell RMS not to do this, I simply removed them at the end of the routine if
they were there.  ckvfio.c, 31 May 96.

Returning the fully qualified filename in the ACK packet wasn't working in
VMS because isabsolute() had never been filled in for VMS.  Filled it in,
somewhat crudely, works now.  ckvfio.c, 31 May 96.

Converted all log names (packet, debug, etc) to fully qualified ones.
dolog(), ckuus4.c, 31 May 96.

Jeff added sleep()'s before all command-line exits that printed messages, to
give them time to make it to the window.  ckuusy.c, 31 May 96.

Added HELP REGET.  ckuus2.c, 31 May 96.

Added select() support for HP-UX 5.21 from John Dunlap.
ckcnet.[ch], 31 May 96.

Added still more disgusting heuristics to chkvar(), because in the act of
fixing the problem of nonparsing of variables in input filename fields, I
reintroduced the recurring bug whereby you can't refer to a directory whose
name starts with F or V or M or $, because Kermit variables also start with
those letters.  ckuus6.c, 31 May 96.

Changed default file transfer display to FULL (curses) for all builds in
which CK_CURSES is defined; otherwise to CRT.  No more dots unless user asks
for them.  ckuusx.c, 31 May 96.

ckuusx.c would not compile under Red Hat Linux because ncurses.h was using
a symbol SP that conflicted with ckcasc.h's symbol SP.  Fixed by undef'ing
SP before including curses.h, and using CHR_SP instead of SP to represent
the ASCII Space character.  ckuusx.c, 1 Jun 96.

Rlogin protocol requires screen-dimension knowledge.  But if you add
-DRLOGCODE to a build that does not have CK_NAWS defined, it fails.  It was
silly in the first place to lump knowledge of screen size and TELNET NAWS
under the same conditional, so I separated them: Now CK_NAWS means NAWS and
CK_TTGWSIZE means we can call ttgwsize() to get screen dimensions, e.g. on
nonnetworking builds.  CK_NAWS and RLOGCODE both require CK_TTGWSIZE, which is
currently defined for UNIX, VMS, and OS2.  Many modules, 1 Jun 96.

Added SET TRANSFER MODE { AUTOMATIC, MANUAL }.  When AUTOMATIC, we switch to
the appropriate binary mode (labeled or binary) and to literal filenames when
system IDs match or are compatible (e.g. DOS and OS/2).

Added display of these to SHOW FILE & SHOW PROTOCOL.
Added a constant string cksysid to contain our own system ID.
Added sending and receiving of system ID in S/I packet and its ACK.
Added struct sysdata sysidlist[] with data about different system types.
Added getsysid(s) to return system type name given system ID s.
Added display of remote system ID to fullscreen file transfer display.
Added remote system ID info to transaction log.
Added remote system ID info to STATISTICS display.
Added whoarewe() to switch transfer mode based on system IDs.
Called whoarewe() upon reception of init string, in spar().

Changed UNIX & OS/2 zrtol() to lowercase the incoming filename only if
it was ALL UPPERCASE.  So now if we get "foo.tar.Z", even if FILE NAMES
are CONVERTED, we don't lowercase the Z.

Changed UNIX and OS/2 zltor() treatment of multiple periods.  Previously,
the first one would be kept, and all subsequent ones would become X's.
Now the *last* one is kept and all previous ones become underscores.  This
makes people happy who download foo.tar.gz files, etc.

Changed buffer used by UNIX and OS/2 zltor, zstrip, and zrtol to be MAXPATH
long rather than a hardwired number.

All the above, many modules, 1-2 Jun 96.

Fixed ckcnet.h not to define NOLISTEN for OS2, which prevented "set host *"
from working.  2 Jun 96.

Fixes from Jeff to all the above fixes to fix broken compilation on OS/2.
3 Jun 96.

Bug watch: connecting back to a telnet host after logging out and with
SET PARITY SPACE (or whatever) results in Telnet negotiations having their
8th bit chopped off...

Introduced a new symbol, CKMAXPATH, in ckcdeb.h, to be used when allocating
space for file (path) names, and fixed buffer declarations in many modules to
use it, particularly for the names of the debug and other logs, which still
had hardwired lengths of 50 (!).  EMACS command-of-the-day: ESC-x
tags-query-replace.  3 Jun 96.

Fixed chkvar() AGAIN.  ckuus6.c, 3 Jun 96.

Simplified all of the ridiculous file transfer mode saving and restoring,
and ensured that if the transfer mode (variable "binary") is set because of
system-ID negotiation, that it is restored to the user's value upon exit
from the protocol module.  This was accomplished by removing dozens of 
ad-hoc saving-and-restoring sequences from all over the place and just:

 1. Setting both the nominal and saved values in the SET command;
 2. Enclosing the protocol module in a wrapper that saves, then restores;
 3. Restoring the values in the Ctrl-C trap.

Only send the true system ID string if SET TRANSFER MODE is AUTO.  Otherwise
send a system ID of "0".  Don't do any automatic system-ID mode switching if
the other Kermit's system ID is "0".  rpar()/spar(), ckcfns.c, 4 Jun 96.

Somehow the sense of SET { SEND, RECEIVE } PATHNAMES got reversed, I don't
know when.  1 = strip, 0 = keep them on.  I changed the defaults to be 0
in ckcmai.c, rather than 1.  4 Jun 96.

Changed the BYE command to hang up the connection, if it was a network
connection because TCP/IP connections, when closed from the other side, still
appear to be open and so result in the annoying "A network connection might
still be active, OK to exit?" message when you know perfectly well it is
closed.  Done by setting Yet Another Global flag, bye_active, when the client
end of the BYE command is active, so when (if) the ACK is received in the
protocol module, the connection is hung up.  Many modules, 4 Jun 96.

Fixed a bug introduced in zltor() yesterday which might potentially put the
period in the wrong place.  ckufio.c, 4 Jun 96.

Fixed SET SERVER GET-PATH to append directory separator to end of directory
name if missing, in OS2 version (it already took care of this in other
versions).  ckuus3.c, 5 Jun 96.

Changed CONNECT-mode escape H to be Help rather than Hangup, and made U
be Hangup, in the UNIX, VMS, AOS, VOS, OS-9, Amiga, and ST versions, to
conform with the Windows and OS/2 versions, and with the principle of least
astonishment.  ck*con.c, 5 Jun 96.

Fixes from Jeff to directory-listing and delete-response generators for
server.  ckcfns.c, 5 Jun 96.

Added SET TERM { HEIGHT, WIDTH } for non-OS/2 versions.  Just sets the tt_blah
variables in case ttgwsize() can't get them from the system.  Also fixed a
glitch in the non-OS/2 SHOW TERM display.  ckuus7.c, 5 Jun 96.

Added #ifdef BEBOX code, including an alarm() routine for the BeBox from
Neal Murphy at Motorola.  Untested.  Many modules.  6 Jun 96.

Removed the code from UNIX tthang() that lowered RTS, suspecting that it might
be the cause for all the trouble with the Solaris Port Monitor.  Bo Kullmar
tested it in Sweden, verified that it cured the problem.  ckutio.c, 6 Jun 96.

Added auotupload to the UNIX version.  It's simple.  Instead of only looking
for an S packet, we also look for an I packet.  If we get one, we go into
server mode instead of receive mode, and we set a flag that says that when
the transfer is complete, i.e. after the B packet has been sent and ACK'd,
that instead of going back to server command wait, we (reset the flag and)
return from the protocol module.  So really, it's more than autoupload,
it's auto-any-client/server-command, although some of them don't make any
sense, like REMOTE DIRECTORY (unless it includes a redirector) -- but they
still work.  ckcfns.c, ckcpro.w, ckucon.c, 6 Jun 96.

Added autoupload to VMS version.  This was a lot easier because we don't
have the stupid forks, pipes, and signals to deal with when changing a
variable.  ckvcon.c, 6 Jun 96.

Fixed OUTPUT to allow outputting of lines > 80 characters long.  Yet Another
Stupid String Termination bug, discovered by Volkmar Grote. ckuus5.c, 7 Jun 96.

Patches to yesterday's BeBox updates from Neal Murphy.  ckuus5.c, 7 Jun 96.

Moved kstart() and zstart() to ckcfn2.c, so they did not need to be replicated
in each CONNECT module.  ck[cu]con.c, ckcfn2.c, ckcker.h, 7 Jun 96.

Made SERVER DISPLAY ON the default for all versions.  ckcmai.c, 7 Jun 96.

Moved code that checks for console interrupts (X, Z, E, etc) from input()
to rpack(), to make sure it will be executed every time through the loop.
ckcfn2.c, 7 Jun 96.

When C-K was the "autoupload server" and it got a request for a file that
it didn't have, it failed to leave server mode.  Fixed in ckcpro.w, 10 Jun 96.

More of the same -- changed just about every "SERVE" to "RESUME" in ckcpro.w,
11 Jun 96.

2.11 BSD...  A lot of work on the makefile, added a fifth overlay in hopes of
getting this version compiled.  Added a sixth overlay, rearranged the overlays
for better fit (making each as close to 16K as possible), fixed up some
#ifdefs.  Got rid of explict references to sys_errlist[] (should do this for
all other versions where strerr() or strerror() is available, but who knows
where that is...)  Eventually got it to build and run OK (but very slowly),
without a DIAL command.  Added MINIDIAL, plus another overlay, but result was
WAY too big.  Put NODIAL back, reshuffled overlays and root segment again so
the hardest-hit modules were in the root segment, and got it back down to 5
overlays (from 7).  Later, changed the entire overlay structure: 40K in root
segment, four 24K overlays.  Compiles and runs, but still very jerky because
I still need to free up at least 3-5K of data (e.g. static buffers).  Also
should put all the new dial-directory-related stuff in MINIDIAL ifdefs so
DIAL can be restored.  ckubs2.mak, 11-12 Jun 96.

Fixed a problem in VMS do_label_receive, in which it referenced a pointer
that might be null, without checking first.  Now VMS-to-VMS transfers (which
pop automatically into labeled mode) work fine.  ckvfio.c, 12 Jun 96.

Many adjustments to the makefile, #ifdefs in many modules, etc, as a result of
compiling on many platforms.  Discovered that Rlogin code could not be
built on all UNIXes because they don't all have SIGURG, so another convention
of #ifdefs for ckcnet.h...  12-13 Jun 96.

More 2.11 BSD.  Change CKMAXPATH from 1023 to 255, affecting about 7 static
buffers, so 7 x 768 = about 5K, theoretically enough for the needed stdio
buffers in data space.  And (another hour of compiling and linking later) this
finally did the trick -- it runs quite snappily now.  See comments in
ckubs2.mak.  13 Jun 96.

Changed certain HP-UX 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x entries in makefile to skip
optimization of ckcpro.c, which tends to blow up the HP optimizer.
13 Jun 96.

Fixed typos in HP-UX 5.21 select()-support code.  ckcnet.h, 13 Jun 96.

---- (uploaded Beta.025, 13 Jun 96) -----

Made H an acceptable abbreviation for HELP.  ckuusr.c, 14 Jun 96.

Made "set block-check <ESC>" supply 3 instead of 1.  ckuus3.c, 14 Jun 96.

Added a Latin-2 Compose key to K95/K2.  ckocon.[ch], ckoco3.c, 16 Jun 96.

Updated ck9ker.mak for ck[cu]sig.[ch] and also added a couple missing
depencies to the UNIX makefile.  19 Jun 96.

Adjustments to Tandy 1600 and HP-UX 7.x makefile entries; new entries added
for HP-UX 6.5.  20 Jun 96.

Added -Q (Quick) command-line switch for starting Kermit with fast
file-transfer options (20 window slots, 4096-byte packets, cautious
unprefixing).  22 Jun 96.

Fixed a show-stopper in the VMS version that prevented Labeled receives
from working at all (in do_label_recv, I was checking the size of the 
vms_ofile buffer against the wrong constant).  ckvfio.c, 23 Jun 96.

Changed SET FILE DISPLAY to SET TRANSFER DISPLAY -- more appropriate.
SET FILE DISPLAY still works, but is invisible.  ckuus[37].c, ckuusr.h,
23 Jun 96.

Malloc'd INPUT buffer wasn't being initialized.  Now it is.
ckuus5.c, 16 Jun 96.

---1.1.5---

Added REGET to server's help message.  ckcmai.c, 4 Jul 96.

Added WHATAMI to SHOW FEATURES display.  ckuus5.c, 4 Jul 96.

Added SERVER LOGIN display to SHOW SERVER.  ckuus5.c, 4 Jul 96.

Made "e" an abbreviation for "exit" (again).  ckuusr.c, 4 Jul 96.

Corrected some bad references to ofn1 (it's an array, not a pointer).
ckcfns.c, ckcfn3.c, 8 Jul 96.

Fixed another bug in chkvar() that prevented it from recognizing array
references, which in turn prevented cmifi() from expanding an array reference
to get the filename.  ckuus6.c, 8 Jul 96.

Fixed DIRECTORY command error message for OS/2.  ckuus6.c, 10 Jul 96.

Added variable \v(apcactive).  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, 10 Jul 96.

Fixed OS2/WIN DIR command to handle "dir blah", when "blah" is not a directory
name, to append ".*" to it.  ckuus6.c, 12 Jul 96.

Added ttol() time debugging for OS2/WIN, and made it selectable with #ifdef
GETMSEC (but don't define this unless there is a corresponding getmsec()
routine in ck?tio.c).  ckcfn2.c, 12 Jul 96.

OS2/WIN zopeni() now opens in shared non-write mode, so can type, send, etc,
can open files that other processes had opened, even for writing.  ckufio.c,
12 Jul 96.

Fixed cmnum() to recognize \\\%i -- first evaluate \%i to get (e.g. \128),
then call xxesc() to get 128, then succeed.  ckucmd.c, 13 Jul 96.

While testing Kermit file transfer performance on a very bad connection, in
which 80-90% of all packets get damaged, it was observed that the timeouts
quickly rise to ridiculous levels.  This is, in general, to be expected since
the timeout is based on the time between when a packet is sent and its ACK is
received.  To alleviate the situation, the following adjustments were made to
the timeout calculation:

 . The packet's time stamp is updated if we retransmit it.  Previously, it
   was set only when it was first transmitted.

 . When sending a NAK for packet n, update timestamp of packet n-1 (mod 64),
   which is the ACK or NAK we sent for the previous packet, since this is
   how the file receiver determines round-trip delay.

The problem is that there is no good way for the file sender to distinguish
between a very noisy connection that has no delays and a clean connection with
long delays, or for that matter a noisy connection with long delays.  The file
receiver responds to a bad packet the same way it responds to a timeout: it
sends a NAK.  The file sender does not know *why* the NAK was sent.  The
situation is exacerbated when packets are corrupted so badly that they are not
recognized as packets -- e.g. when the packet-start character is mangled or
lost.  In that case, we get a timeout anyway, instead of immediately sensing a
checksum/CRC error.

It might be possible for low-level packet-reading code (ttinl) to keep track
of the total number of characters read vs the number of packet characters
read, and if the ratio crosses a certain threshhold, the upper-level code
could infer the line was noisy.  But that still says nothing its delay
characteristics.  So the real question remains: how can you tell what the
delay is?  You can't, without uncorrupted packets.  So hopefully the two
changes above will result in a delay calculation that is more resistent to
noise effects.  ckcfn2.c, 13 Jul 96.  (BUT SEE ENTRY BELOW FOR A SOLUTION.)

A similar problem occurs when we reduce packet lengths because of errors.  We
don't know WHY the error occurred.  If it was because of noise, it is probably
safe to grow packets back to their original size as the noise abates.  But if
it was because of a buffer overflow, it is not safe.  Note that if a buffer is
too small for a packet to begin with, the packet will never get through at
all.  However, there seems to be a fairly common condition in which a packet
of a certain size, say 8K, will often, but not always fail, and yet a packet
of a certain smaller size, say 4K, will hardly ever fail.  In a situation like
this, our current algorithm keeps the packet length oscillating -- we always
go back up to 8K, where it probably fails again, then we go back to 4K, and
on and on.

This effect is exacerbated when using sliding windows.  Suppose we send
sixteen 8K packets before any responses come back.  Then we get 4 ACKs
followed by 12 NAKs.  Each NAK causes us to halve the packet length so we
instantly drop down to 2-byte packets (except there is a minimum of 20 or so).
This is clearly an overreaction.  Probably we only needed to halve it once.
But wait, it gets worse.  Since we can never retransmit a packet in any form
different from its original form, we must retransmit the 12 NAK'd packets in
their original 8K form, which will only make the error count rise, keeping the
length for new packets at a minimum.  So new packets are going out with a
length of 20, while the original 8K ones are being retransmitted over and over
until they all finally get through or the retry limit is exhausted.  Now the
20-byte length creeps back up because there are no more buffer overflows.  But
eventually the threshhold is crossed and a burst of packets goes out that is
too long, and the process repeats: continuous oscillation between 20 bytes and
8192 bytes.

So we need a way to prevent overzealous length reduction at the beginning,
AND we need a way of finding the optimal length to stop at when increasing the
size after errors have subsided.

When we get a NAK or a timeout, how do we know whether to halve the packet
length?  Instead of ALWAYS halving it when there is any kind of error, we'll
make the new length half the length of THE PACKET THAT CAUSED THE ERROR --
the one that was NAK'd, or the one whose ACK we were waiting for.

Thus, in the scenario above, after sending 16 8K packets, and getting lots of
NAKs, we reduce the length of the 17th packet 4K bytes rather than to 8K/2^12,
which is just silly.  If we get an error on the 17th packet, then the 18th
packet will be 2K bytes, and so on.

After reducing the packet length, how far should we increase it after we stop
getting errors?  To answer this, we'll have the sender record the length of
the longest packet that was ACK'd without ever being NAK'd or retransmitted.
The danger here is not being able to recover from a transient condition that
subsequently cleared up.  Or worse: never being able to get past 20 bytes,
because (in the scenario just described), that will be the longest packet that
was ACK'd without ever being NAK'd or retransmitted.

So here is our new strategy for managing packet lengths:

1. Slow start.  If the negotiated packet length is 500 or greater, we start
   our first data packet at 244 bytes (thus ensuring that it fits in a typical
   256-byte buffer).  If it is ACK'd the first time, we double it for the next
   packet, and if that one is ACK'd the first time, we double again, and so on
   up to the maximum negotiated length.  We stop doing this, however, the
   first time we get a NAK or a timeout.  Note that when using sliding
   windows, the first ACK for a data packet might not arrive until after quite
   a few have been sent out at the initial short slow-start length.

2. Each time we get an ACK for a packet that was never NAK'd or retransmitted,
   if it was longer than any previous such packet, we record its length as the
   "best length".  Thus the best length grows during the slow-start period.
   (Obviously we set best length to 0 at the beginning of transaction.)

3. Each time we get an ACK, if the current length for sending packets is less
   than the best length, we increase it by 1/3 the difference between it and
   the best length.

But suppose the best length is small because of a transient condition.  How
can we increase it?  For every nth packet, where n = window slots + 1, we
increase the packet size beyond the best length as a one-shot deal (1/3 of the
way between the best length and the maximum negotiated length).  If we get an
ACK back for it next time around, this automatically bumps up the best length.

All of this: ckcnf[s2].c, 13 Jul 96.

Restored the short sleep before ttres() in ckcpro.w.  It is definitely
needed in SunOS 4.x on serial connections.  Otherwise the ACK to the B
packet gets cut off by ttres().  14 Jul 96.

Moved the GETMSEC definition to ckcdeb.h.  Fixed UNIX getmsec() to initialize
its base time to the current time the first time it is called.  Otherwise we
get overflows.  14 Jul 96.  (Note, if we can generalize this routine to all
platforms, we could use millisecond precision in our RTT calculations.)

Experiments show that under noisy conditions, the timeouts still get way too
long, e.g. hundreds of seconds when it is perfectly obvious that packets
arrive every 4 or 5 seconds.  A small amount of long overdue thought reveals
that the round-trip time is not what we should be looking at in the general
(more than 1 window slot) case.  Kermit is not X.25, with a separate timer
for each packet (maybe it should be, but that's another story -- but in C you
can't have multiple alarms pending).

Instead of measuring the round-trip time, we should be measuring the interval
at which packets arrive.  When the window size is 1, this is the same as the
round trip time.  But when the window size is > 1, the round trip time is the
amount of time it takes for a whole WINDOW full of packets to arrive, not the
amount of time it should take the next packet to arrive.

So getrtt() was modified to base the packet timeout on the packet arrival
interval rather than the round trip time.  The RTT is still displayed, but
it's not used in the timeout calculation all.  This was a trivial modification
for the file sender, but with the new possibility of a slow start, the
receiver needed a little extra margin of safety during the first round of
packets -- and the cruder it was, the better it worked (if we've received less
than 32 packets, we double the calculated timeout value; otherwise, if less
64, we increase it by 50% -- anything smoother tended to fail).  ckcfn2.c,
14 Jul 96.

Added SET TRANSFER SLOW-START { ON, OFF }, default ON, to let the user turn
off the slow start mechanism if desired.  ckuusr.h, ckuus[23].c, ckcfn[23].c,
ckcmai.c, 14 Jul 96.

Changed the fullscreen file transfer display to give feedback immediately when
X or Z is pressed, since interruption can take quite a while on a slow
connection with a big window size.  Also uppercased SENDING and RECEIVING to
make them easier to spot.  ckuusx.c, 14 Jul 96.

Jeff fixed a problem in cmdini() where the INPUT buffer was being initialized
using the wrong buffer size, resulting in crashes when the program started
when the inpbufsiz variable had a different value than the INPBUFSIZ constant.
ckuus5.c, 14 Jul 96.

Made RTS/CTS the default flow control for K95/K2.  14 Jul 96.

Added SLOW-START display to SHOW PROTOCOL.  ckuus4.c, 15 Jul 96.

Show myipaddr[] on fullscreen file-transfer display screen if known.
ckuusx.c, 15 Jul 96.

Added SET FLOW-CONTROL AUTOMATIC and made it the default.  ckcmai.c,
ckuus[237].c, ckcdeb.h, 16 Jul 96.

Added additional fields to SET SEND TIMEOUT <secs> { FIXED, DYNAMIC }.
If they say "dynamic", then they can also specify a minimum and maximum value.
This should let them overcome any bugs or misbehavior by the dynamic code.
ckcmai.c, ckuus7.c, ckcfn2.c, 16 Jul 96.

Removed percent efficiency display from file-transfer screen, and also, except
for local-mode direct serial connections, from STAT output.  ckuus[4x].c,
17 Jul 96.

--- 1.1.7 ---

Changed default EXIT WARNING to ON.  ckuusr.c, 28 Jul 96.

Added -E command line switch, ckuusy.c, 28 Jul 96.

Added \v(crc16) variable.  Contains 16-bit CRC of the most recent file
or file group sent or received.  28 Jul 96.

Added IF <n> <command>.  Executes <command> if <n> is a nonzero number, does
not execute command if <n> is 0.  Can be negated with NOT.  ckuus6.c, 4 Aug 96.

Changed \fbreak(s1,s2) to allow s2 to be a string, rather than just one char,
so now it's symmetrical with \fspan(), like in Snobol.  ckuus4.c, 4 Aug 96.

Changed \fexec() to allow its arguments to be separated by commas as well
as by spaces, since requiring spaces made it impossible to use fexec() in
any field that called for a single word.  ckuus4.c, 4 Aug 96.

Added XECHO, which is just like WRITE SCREEN.  ckuusr.[ch], 4 Aug 96.

Fixed UNIX version of zfnqfp() to expand tildes properly.  ckufio.c, 5 Aug 96.

Added \fpathname(file) to return full pathname of file.  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c,
5 Aug 96.

Added CLEAR APC.  This lets the host send an APC that makes Kermit not
return to CONNECT mode after executing the APC.  ckuusr.[ch], ckuus4.c,
5 Aug 96. 

Made local variables work for command files as well as macros.  ckuus5.c,
6 Aug 96.

Added \fchecksum(text) and \fcrc16(text).  ckuusr.h, ckcfn2.c, ckuus4.c,
10 Aug 96.

Changed OPEN READ to allow specification of an optional buffer size after
the filename, and the READ buffer is now malloc'd.  ckuus6.c.  Also, started
to add a method for reading specific-sized blocks from files, rather than
lines, but gave up on it because there is no way to use such a block once it
has been read if it contains a null.  See #ifdef BINREAD.  11 Aug 96.

Began merging Neal Murphy's BeBox changes.  Most drastic was the CONNECT
module, which was completely reorganized because BeOS doesn't have fork().
Seems to be OK on various UNIXes.  ckucon.c, 17 Aug 96.

Updated ckutio.c, ckucmd.c, ckcdeb.h, and the makefile for BeBox.  17 Aug 96.

New BSD211-specific modules from Steven Schultz.  cku2tm.c ckubs2.mak ckustr.c
ckustr.sed, 17 Aug 96.

Added code to fix "dir a:" in PC version, untested.  ckuus6.c, 17 Aug 96.

Fixed command parser asking for "more?" to be exactly when needed, rather than
one line before it was needed (e.g. when you type "?" at the prompt).
ckucmd.c, 17 Aug 96.

GET with DELETE -- Client tells server to MOVE files.  Client command is
RETRIEVE.  Just like GET, but sends H packet rather than R.  Server gets H
packet and acts just like GET, except sets flag saying to delete each file
after -- and if and only if -- it is sent successfully.  Also ENABLE/DISABLE
RETRIEVE, SHOW SERVER, REMOTE HELP message, etc.  RETRIEVE is initially
disabled for safety.  ckcpro.w ckuusr.h ckcker.h ckuusr.c, 17 Aug 96.

IF EXIST \%a <command> was changed to simply fail if \%a was not defined,
rather than giving an error message.  This allows for IF EXIST \$(NAME), etc,
whether or not NAME is defined, e.g. IF EXIST \$(K95CUSTOM).  ckuus6.c,
18 Aug 96.

Made DISABLE BYE the default for OS/2 & Windows.  The consequences of typing
BYE at a remote Kermit prompt (with autodownload enabled in the local Kermit)
are pretty drastic otherwise.  ckcmai.c, 18 Aug 96.

Allow increment in FOR command to be zero.  Why not?  ckuus6.c, 18 Aug 96.

Made SET FILE CHARACTER-SET choose the appropriate TRANSFER CHARACTER-SET,
but only if the current TRANSFER CHARACTER-SET was TRANSPARENT.  ckuus7.c,
18 Aug 96.

Fixed transaction log to show fully qualified filename of files being sent.
ckcfns.c, 18 Aug 96.

Fixed CHECK PUSH to fail if the NOPUSH command had been given.  ckuus3.c,
18 Aug 96.

Fixed MSLEEP hh:mm:ss.  ckuus6.c, 18 Aug 96.

Fixed ASK, ASKQ, and GETOK to not RE-evaluate their arguments after having
evaluated them already.  Prior to this fix, the sequence:

  def \%a c:\foo\dog\moo\x.x
  ask \%b { OK to delete \fcontents(\%a)? }

would not work because ASK does an implicit SET PROMPT, and SET PROMPT
evaluates the prompt again.  ckuus6.c, 18 Aug 96.

Fixed function argument parsing to be consistent.  Braces are used around
arguments to keep leading and/or trailing spaces AND to treat commas as
literal characters rather than argument separators.  Previously, leading or
trailing spaces could not be passed to functions as arguments, and there were
lots of function-specific hacks, now all gone; the same rules apply to all.
ckuus4.c, 18 Aug 96.

Fixed \v(dialresult) not to include trailing control characters.
ckudial.c, 18 Aug 96.

Added ENABLE/DISABLE { MAIL, PRINT } to allow these actions to be separately
enabled and disabled.  Doesn't work like other ENABLE/DISABLE items -- instead
it works by attribute refusal, but that's the best we can do.  Lots of files.  
18 Aug 96.

Added SET TRANSFER BELL { ON, OFF } for people who hate the beep.
ckuusr.h, ckuus3.c, ckuusx.c, 18 aug 96.

Added a bunch of makefile changes for various SunSoft Interactive UNIX
variations, from Larry Jones <larry.jones@sdrc.com>, 18 Aug 96.

Fixed cmtxt() to do the right thing when ESC typed at the beginning of
a field for which there is no default -- namely beep instead of putting a
space into the command buffer.  Also allowed completion to work if the
text typed into the field so far matches the left substring of the default
(if any) of the same length.  ckucmd.c, 19 Aug 96.

In the UNIX, Windows, and OS/2 versions, the CD command (actually, zhdir()),
if it failed, would try lowercasing the name and trying again.  This was both
confusing and wrong, and gave misleading error messages (e.g. in UNIX,
"cd FOO" said "foo: No such directory"), so I removed the lowercasing-and-
trying-again code.  ckufio.c, 19 Aug 96.

Fixed a nasty bug in the UNIX bug with SET DESTINATION PRINTER -- the
arguments to zprint() were reversed...  (again???)  ckufio.c, 19 Aug 96.

There was evidently a problem in the logic for treating a NAK for packet n+1
as an ACK for packet n, in which most of the code to handle an ACK was being
bypassed in this case (buffer/window shuffling, etc).  So I added a hack to
the input() routine to change the N into a Y and to decrement the sequence
number (mod 64 of course) and then go back and execute the entire block of
code for the ACK.  This is fairly hard to test...  ckcfn2.c, 19 Aug 96.

Fixed gmdmtyp() to not assume that modem type was only to be found in mdmsav
if a network connection was active.  In fact, network modem dialing is done
with SET HOST first, SET MODEM TYPE second, so the modem type is never saved.
ckuus4.c, 19 Aug 96.

Changed the control-character parsing routines to allow not only a numeric
representation like "27" for Escape, but also to accept the control character
typed literally (but in that case it must be preceded by a backslash, and even
then, not all control chars can be entered this way, e.g. Ctrl-C), and also ^X
notation (caret followed by any ASCII character 63-95 or 97-122; lowercase
letters are converted to uppercase).  This affects SET ESCAPE, SET S/R
PAD-CHAR, packet-start/end, etc.  There is now a new setcc() routine that can
be called from anywhere to parse a control character (as long as it is the
final item in the command).  ckuus[37].c, ckcker.h, 20 Aug 96.

Added a new symbol, DOOMSDAY, which is defined for versions that have
implemented "Doomsday Kermit" protocol (currently UNIX, VMS, OS/2).  ckcdeb.h,
ckuus7.c, 20 Aug 96.

Changed UNIX i/o modules to make SET CARRIER ON and AUTO apply to file
transfer as well as to CONNECT mode, in hopes of getting file transfers to
fail and pop back to the prompt immediately if carrier drops and SET CARRIER
is AUTO or ON.  No way to test here -- neither my NeXT nor watsun cares one
bit about carrier.  ttinl(), mygetbuf(), ttpkt(): ckutio.c, 20 Aug 96.  

Updated man page, ckcker.upd, with recent stuff.  20 Aug 96.

Fixed bug introduced in Monday's changes that made a spurious "Refused"
message pop up every time C-K received a file in local mode.  ckcpro.w,
21 Aug 96.

Log full pathname of received file in transaction log.  ckcfn3.c, 21 Aug 96.

If user says "send *.*" and one or more of the matching files is not readable,
there was previously no indication of error.  Now we (a) count the file as
not sent (for the STATISTICS display), (b) make a transaction-log entry, and
(c) put a message on the file transfer display if in local mode.  gnfile(),
ckcfns.c, 21 Aug 96.

There has always been the horrible bug in VMS C-Kermit that the SEND and OPEN
READ file shared the same RMS channel.  Thus you could not send a file and
have an OPEN READ file at the same time.  If you closed one, it would close
the other, etc.  So I tried to fix this by cloning ALL of the fab/rab/xab/blab
structures and and buffers and pointers and routines and code (I'm sure there
must be a better way but I'm not a VMS programmer).  In so doing, I noticed
that the filesize for a SEND file was being set in zchki() rather than
zopeni(), and so if this ever worked, it was purely by accident, since how do
we know that the file we are sending is the one we most recently zchki'd?  So
I moved and separated all of the size getting to the appropriate places.
Anyway finally I got it all done and working.  Really gross.  But it's better
now, at least because (for example) zchin() no longer ASSUMES it is reading
from ZIFILE.  Test: make a file containing a list of filenames.  Then write a
command file that opens the other file, reads a line at a time into a
variable, and then sends the file whose name is in the variable, then TAKE
the command file.  Works OK.  CKVFIO.C, 21 Aug 96.

Changed the TYPE command in VMS to just call the system's TYPE command, since
the built-in one was EXCRUTIATINGLY slow.  (But if it is, then so is reading
from files -- hmmm, what exactly was the bottleneck?  If we knew, maybe we
could speed up VMS file transfer by a whole lot.)  Also, the previous TYPE
command was not interruptible, though I don't know why.  Made the new one
interuptible again.  ckuus6.c, 21 Aug 96.

Numerous fixes to ifdefs, casts, etc etc, many modules.  21 Aug 96.

Data General AOS/VS networking was broken by recent additions (getting my
own IP address, maybe also the linger/nodelay/recvbuf/etc stuff too), so I
#ifdef'd all of them away.  Now it works again.  ckcnet.c, 22 Aug 96.

Reshuffled overlays for BSD2.11, builds OK now.  ckubs2.mak, 22 Aug 96.

---(Beta.029)---

Added #ifndef NOIADDRX..#endif around the section that defines INADDRX in
ckcnet.h, because evidently the new release of DG/UX changed the definition
of inet_addr().  27 Aug 96.

Added \fbasename(filespec).  ckuusr.h, ckuus4.c, 1 Sep 96.

Fixed zstrip() to take care not write past the end of its buffer.  ckufio.c,
1 Sep 96.

Fixed IF NUMERIC <var> <cmd> to fail gracefully if the variable is not
defined.  ckuus6.c, 1 Sep 96.

Added _ASG as a synonym for _ASSIGN.  ckuusr.c, 1 Sep 96.

Fixed PRINT command to actually allow trailing print options (arguments to
zprint were reversed here too...).  ckuusr.c, 3 Sep 96.

Changed stray reference to memset() to bzero() in ckcnet.c.  memset() is not
portable.  5 Sep 96.

Added S as a file-transfer interrupt command, for "Status" -- same as A, but
why should we use S for Status in terminal mode, and A for Status in protocol
mode?  ckuusx.c, 5 Sep 96.

---(USING C-KERMIT SECOND EDITION)---

Merged Martin Zinser's VMS changes (DEC C vs VAX C / VAX vs Alpha / etc etc).
Many modules, plus a whole new build procedure.  17 Sep 96.

Merged Jeff's changes.  Many modules.  17 Sep 96.

Built VMS C-K on VAX/VMS 5.5-2 OK with new CKVKER.COM.  But CKVKER.COM does not
work on VMS 6.2 on either VAX or Alpha -- some kind of syntax error in the COM
file.  But updated sources build OK using old makefile.

As for sources...  They compile fine on an Alpha with DECC 5.3, but on a VAX
with DECC 5.3, there are lots of warnings about alarm() not being declared,
plus bzero, bcopy, inet_ntoa, inet_addr (this on a TGV system).  Then it dies
in ckvfio.c because of an undefined struct member.  17 Sep 96.

VMS (19 Sep 96)...

alarm() complaints.  Removed #define alarm decc$alarm from ckcnet.h.
 . ckudia.c now compiles OK on VAX / VMS 6.2 / DEC C 5.3-006 / TGV 4.0D.
 . it compiles OK on VAX / VMS 5.5-2 / VAX C 3.1 / UCX

Got rid of all #module directives from ckv*.c modules.  No problem, who
needs it.

And at Mark Berryman's suggestion:

Got rid of all references to xaballdef$$_fill_7, used xab$b_bkz instead.
Added #include <strings.h> to MultiNet compiles to pick up bzero & friends.
Removed attempt to make &x be size_t in set/getsockopt() calls for MultiNet.
Added #include "multinet_root:[multinet.include.netinet]inet.h" to pick up
defs for inet_addr() and inet_ntoa().  #included <strings.h> for bcopy() and
bzero().  Finally, it compiled and linked, and it worked, on both the VAX and
the Alpha.

But it won't build on SPCVXA (TGV 4.0 field test / VAX C 3.2) because it can't
find <strings.h>.  Removed #include <strings.h>, inserted hardwired prototypes
for bcopy and bzero.  Builds OK on SPCVXA.  Builds OK Alpha (TGV 4.0A / DECC
5.3).  Builds OK on VAX (also TGV 4.0A / DECC 5.3).  Builds OK on another VAX
with VMS 5.4-2, TGV 3.5D, and VAXC 3.1.

Does NOT build OK on an Alpha with VMS 6.2, TGV 3.5B, and an unknown DEC C
version; gets syntax errors right away in the system header files
(SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]DECC$RTLDEF.TLB: STDLIB, STAT, UNIXIO modules).  Maybe if
the new CKVKER.COM file worked, it would help?

Peter Eichhorn noticed that dialing stopped suddenly on HP-UX right after
Kermit told the modem to use RTS/CTS.  That's because, even though Kermit had
been told to "set flow rts/cts" (or auto), it does not actually take affect
until after dialing is complete.  So if RTS was not being asserted (as it was
not in this case), the modem would never send any more characters back to the
computer, and dialing would fail.  Tentative solution: add a new low-level
communications routine, ttsetflow(), to ckutio.c; document it in ckcplm.doc.
Call it from ckudia.c just after the aforementioned modem command returns OK.
Put the call within #ifdef CK_TTSETFLOW..#endif.  In ckcdeb.h, define
CK_TTSETFLOW for UNIX.  If this works out, maybe we can use this routine in
a lot of other places for simplification and sanity.  21 Sep 96.

READing from a pipe was busted in the last edit, when the READ buffer was
made dynamic.  I forgot to add the buffer allocation code to the OPEN !READ
command.  Fixed in ckuus6.c, 21 Sep 96.

Changed the fullscreen file transfer display to show the bytes received so
far, rather than a blank "Percent done", when receiving a file whose size
is not known.  Suggested by Peter Eichhorn.  ckuusx.c, 21 Sep 96.

Changed ENABLE/DISABLE commands to allow an optional trailing argument:
REMOTE, LOCAL, or BOTH (default = BOTH).  Server services are now enabled or
disabled separately for remote and local mode.  The en_xxx flags are now 2-bit
fields, with values 0..3.  The protocol module has a new macro, ENABLED, to
check them.  Changed the defaults for RETRIEVE, DELETE, HOST, and BYE to
"remote-only", meaning they are enabled in remote mode, disabled in local
mode, to prevent nasty surprises caused by autodownload sequences.  Other
services are enabled in both remote and local mode by default, as before.
ckcmai.c, ckuusr.c, ckuus[56].c, ckcpro.w, 22 Sep 96.

REMOTE TYPE, when given from VMS client to VMS server -- or OS/2 client to
OS/2 server -- resulted in labeled file format.  Changed the server to switch
to text mode when handling REMOTE TYPE requests.  ckcpro.w, 22 Sep 96.

Speaking of LABELed mode... In VMS, if a labeled-mode file transfer failed
between the time it started (but the opening of the file was deferred because
the label info had not been processed yet) and the time it was opened for
real, subsequent close operations would fail (because the file had not been
opened yet), and therefore so would subsequent attempts to open ANY output
file, since zopeni() would think that one was already open.  Fixed for VMS
in ckvfio.c, 22 Sep 96.  Might need to be looked at for OS/2 also, but
probably this does not happen there, since in OS/2 we actually do use file
descriptors and C Library for file i/o, rather than the whole separate
parallel world of RMS used by VMS.

How do we decide whether to prefix a control character these days?  We
reference the prefixing table, ctlp[], using the character as an index.  Guess
what: on some platforms, cltp[c] (where "c" is an _unsigned_ character)
results in conversion of c to a signed integer, and therefore sometimes to an
incorrect array reference, and no doubt an out-of-bounds one too.  The packet
encoder was doing this, and in at least one version -- VAX/VMS C-Kermit built
with VAX C 3.2 -- it resulted in failure to encode file bytes with value 0xff,
which corresponds to Telnet IAC, and therefore failure to transfer any file
that contained this character over a Telnet connection.  On VMS-to-VMS
connections, it resulted in failure to transfer ANY file on a Telnet
connection, because 0xff happens to appear in the labeled-file material for
every file.  Fixed in ckcfns.c, 22 Sep 96.

There was another mysterious problem with VMS C-Kermit's parity changing from
SPACE (or other none-NONE value) to NONE whenever a file was transferred.  Not
so mysterious upon close inspection of the code.  When ttpkt() and ttvt() were
combined into ttbin() (not so very recently), the small bit that handled
parity was skipped for network connections.  Fixed now.  ckvtio.c, 22 Sep 96.

Removed some per-character debug log entries from netinc().  ckcnet.c,
22 Sep 96.

At Mike Freeman's request, added a way to let the user specify, when DIAL
CONNECT is ON or AUTO, whether the verbose "Connecting..." message is
displayed if DIAL succeeds and Kermit enters CONNECT mode.  This was done by
allowing the keywords QUIET or VERBOSE after SET DIAL CONNECT ON or AUTO.
ckuusr.c, ckuus3.c, ckuus4.c, 22 Sep 96.

Various updates to help messages.  ckuus2.c, 22 Sep 96.

Changed ckuver.h so \v(cpu) for DG/UX would give precedence to Intel over
Motorola, since evidently their Intel compiler still has the Motorola 88K
manifest constants defined.  ckuver.h, 22 Sep 96.

The SWITCH statement did not work if it was used in a macro and its switching
variable was a macro argument.  Fixed by evaluating the variable prior to
using it, since we are only going to look at it once (unlike, say, a WHILE
or FOR loop variable).  Seems to work fine now, but needs more testing
(add some nested SWITCH tests to CKEDEMO.KSC).  ckuus6.c, 22 Sep 96.

From Bernie Volz at Process Software: Fix problems with compiling on Alpha
for UCX / TCPware; fix byte-swapping of TCP port.  ckcnet.c, 23 Sep 96.

Wasted the entire day on the stupid new CKVKER.COM build procedure.  No good,
forget it, it's a waste.  It doesn't run on 3/4 of the systems it needs to:
the ccopt string is just too long and can't be shortened by even one more byte
(on *some* systems but not others -- both with MultiNet!).  On the few systems
where it *does* run, we get sharable library image mismatches, etc, so I give
up.  Will stick with the makefile.  23 Sep 96.

Added Unicode support for Windows & OS/2 terminal emulators.  Many modules.
1-5 Oct 96.  The new list of terminal character sets supported by the Windows
and OS/2 versions is (* = new):

  ascii
* arabic-iso
  british
  canadian-french
  cp437
  cp850 (Western Europe / Roman)
  cp852 (Central Europe / Roman)
* cp857 (Turkish)
  cp862 (Hebrew)
* cp864 (Arabic)
  cp866 (Cyrillic)
* cp869 (Greek)
  cyrillic-iso
  danish
  dec-mcs
* dec-special
* dec-technical
  dg-international
  dutch
  finnish
  french
  german
* greek
  hebrew-7
  hebrew-iso
  hp-roman8
* hungarian
  italian
* japanese-roman
* katakana
  koi8
  latin1
  latin2
* latin3
* latin4
* latin5
  macintosh-latin
  nextstep
  norwegian
  portuguese
  short-koi
  spanish
  swedish
  swiss

Added three new character-set routines, to hide differences between Unicode
and regular emulators: cs_is_std(), cs_is_nrc(), and cs_size().  These are
available for all but Mac (easy to add for Mac too), but used only by
Windows & OS/2 for GL/GR/G0..G3 stuff.  ckuxla.c, 5 Oct 96.

Added support for pipename to named-pipe entries in net directory.  Found a
bug in the SuperLAT password processing from the net directory, and fixed it.
ckuus7.c, 5 Oct 96.

Finally got rid of the old and stupid feature that '\' was a line continuation
character.  It was interfering badly with Windows and OS/2 commands such as
"cd d:\".  Now only '-' can be used for this.  ckucmd.c, ckuus5.c, 5 Oct 96.

Bug fix from Jeff in parsing of "set command more-prompting".  Various HELP
text touches.  ckuus*.c, 5 Oct 96.

Added -B switch == "force background", e.g. for running in batch; it's the
opposite of -z "force foreground".  Added support for it to DG con*() modules,
in response to a complaint from a user that the DG version errored out when
run in batch ("illegal file type").  To test: "qb kermit -y test.ksc" (should
fail); "qb kermit -By test.ksc" (should work).  Can't test it here: "queue
does not exist".  ckuusy.c, ckdtio.c, 6 Oct 96.

Changed INPUT to treat a timeout of 0 as 0 (sort of), and a negative number as
"infinite", i.e. wait forever.  ckuus4.c, 6 Oct 96.

In response to a complaint, verified that C-Kermit (at least the UNIX version)
did not do anything to the flow control setting of the local terminal when in
command mode, but it *does* disable Xon/Xoff in CONNECT mode (for EMACS,
XMODEM, etc).  Nothing much we can do about this without changing the APIs
to the ck?tio.c modules for all versions, adding new commands to control it
(that nobody will understand), etc.

VMS saga, cont'd:

Installed and slightly updated new CKVKER.COM from Joellen Windsor at the U of
Arizona.  Works OK on local VAX.  Tried building on SNEEZY@USU (Alpha, DECC
5.0, TGV 3.5B) got compile errors in DEC C header-file prototypes: "Ill-formed
parameter type list" for chmod, creat, etc.  Also, "missing type specifier"
for dev_t, off_t, etc.  I'm not going to worry about it; it builds fine at
other sites with similar configurations.  It does seem to build OK on
SLEEPY@USU (with DECC 4.0) except for some complaints regarding args to
get/setsockopt(), and implicit declaration of sleep().

On NETLAB, the oldest configuration I have access to, it complains during
the link step that it can't find SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]VAXCTRLG.OLB or
VAXCRTL.OLB as input, but still produces seemingly OK-working executables.

On SPCVXA, compilation of CKVFIO.C failed because "xab$b_bkz" is not a member
of "xaball_ofile".  Tough, I'm not going to worry about it.

After all this, noticed that Martin Zinser had sent in a few more VMS changes.
Applied the ones that didn't look too dangerous, added the others strictly as
comments.  They all had to do with data types -- casts, size_t vs int, etc.
Rebuilt in a few places, and all seems OK.

On BATON (VAX, VMS 6.2, DECC 5.3), I get this:

---Beta.030---

Learned that HP-UX 10.10 and later needs the newterm() call in curses, whereas
the 10.00 version did not need it and did not make it.  Without this, after
the first fullscreen file transfer display, the terminal modes are messed up
(no echo, etc) -- to be continued...

ckutio.c in IRIX 6.0 needed to include <sys/time.h> for the struct timezone
definition.  Also discovered that later versions of IRIX did not have BIGBUFOK
defined; changed this to depend on the manifest constant "sgi".  10 Oct 96.

Added -mips2 switches to IRIX 5.x and 6.x makefile entries, to prevent code
from being generated for higher-level CPUs that some people don't have.
10 Oct 96.

Fixes for Amiga from Steve Walton.  ckuus5.c, ckusig.c, 14 Oct 96.

Added SET NET TES32 for Emulex TES-32, which uses the SuperLAT interface
(K95).  ckuusr.c, 14 Oct 96.

Fix for SET TERM VIDEO-CHANGE (K95) from Jeff.  ckuus7.c, 14 Oct 96.
Integrated Jeff's other changes too.

OS-9 setsockopt() fix from JE Jones.  ckcnet.c, 14 Oct 96.

Integrated Plan 9 support from Nigel Roles.  So far, serial only.  Many
modules, plus a new makefile, ckpker.mk (and product code "p").  14 Oct 96.

Fixed rlog_ini() to send terminal type and speed also for UNIX, VMS, etc.
ckcnet.c, 15 Oct 96.  Sending the speed required addition of a new ck*tio.c
routine, congspd().  It should only be called within #ifdef CONGSPD..#endif,
which is defined in ckcdeb.h.  This was done for UNIX and VMS.  Win32 and
OS/2 don't need it (the concept of console speed is irrelevant); the others
don't need it because they don't support Rlogin.

Fixed help text for SET EXIT WARNING to say the default is ON (not OFF).
ckuus2.c, 15 Oct 96.

From Carl Friedberg: added missing speeds to the VMS ttspeeds[] struct,
so "set speed <big-number>" would actually work.  ckvtio.c, 15 Oct 96.

Added HP-UX makefile refinements from Peter Eichhorn, and then added
specific HP-UX 10.xx differentiation for all xx's, since it now seems we
need separate builds for each due to curses incompatibilites.  makefile,
19 Oct 96.

HP-UX 10.00, no optimization:   Builds OK, curses OK.
HP-UX 10.00, with optimization: Builds OK, curses OK.
HP-UX 10.10, with optimization: Builds OK, curses OK.

           Runs on.......
Built on   10.00    10.10    10.20    10.30
10.00       yes      No (*)    ?        ?
10.10       No (**)  Yes       ?        ?
10.20        ?        ?        ?        ?
20.30        ?        ?        ?        ?

(*)  Invalid version for shared lib /usr/lib/libc.1, IOT trap (core dumped)
(**) Can't open shared library: /usr/lib/libxcurses.1, Abort (core dumped)

So it would seem we need a separate binary for each HP-UX 10.xx release.

On the other hand...  When tracking down another one of Peter Eichhorn's
reports -- namely that when the terminal type is not defined, that Kermit
doesn't run because initscr() exits, as documented, when the tgetent() buffer
doesn't have good stuff in it.  Now I think this was because I changed the
default file transfer display to fullscreen, but never executed the code that
calls tgetent() because that is called only when a SET TRANSFER DISPLAY
FULLSCREEN command is given.  So now I copied that code to a new routine,
fxdinit() in ckuusx.c, where all the other curses material is, plugged some
stupid holes, made the tgetent() buffer bigger to ward off memory leaks, etc,
and in main() call the new routine just after sysinit().  19 Oct 96.

John Santos discovered that "kermit -j blah" failed if there was no network
directory.  Reason: a variable was not initialized.  Fixed in ckuusy.c,
19 Oct 96.

Paul Kimoto discovered that when C-Kermit was receiving a file sent by another
C-Kermit which was sending from stdin, the modtime of the new file would be
set to -1 (Dec 31, 1969), and he found this was caused by not testing the
return code from zstrdt(), an "internal consolidation" routine.  ckufio.c,
19 Oct 96.

Lucas Hart suggested that SET TERMINAL TYPE be allowed in UNIX, VMS, etc,
but it should just print a message.  Added, ckuus7.c, 19 Oct 96.

Fixed a bug that has been bugging me for years.  On some Telnet connections,
it is necessary to SET PARITY SPACE for file transfer to succeed (because the
Telnet connection itself is not 8-bit clean).  However, once you transfer a
file, Telnet negotiations don't work any more -- even though they did before.
This is most often noticed after logging out and then trying to log back in
again (since Telnet negotiations *usually* happen only at the beginning of a
session).  The fix was rather complicated, involving most tt*() routines in
ckutio.c, plus ckcgetc() in ckucon.c, plus calls to tn_doop() in ckucon.c.
Basically, parity-stripping was moved up to a higher level.  We always do it
during packet operations, but, on TELNET connections only, in CONNECT mode
(and INPUT, etc) we do it only after first checking for IAC and passing
negotiations along to tn_doop().  20 Oct 96.

Made the analogous changes in the VMS version: ckvtio.c, ckvcon.c, 20 Oct 96.
This is supposed to cure the problems with transferring files over Telnet
(and other) connections that some people say started in Beta.030.  Time will
tell.

Fixed a couple misplaced #ifdefs, noticed by Mike Long.  ckudia.c, ckuus5.c,
20 Oct 96.

Added additional #ifdefs needed for supporting DECC in UNIX (e.g. Digital
UNIX 4.0) as well as VMS.  ckcdeb.h, ...  20 Oct, 96.

Added a new makefile entry and symbol for Digital UNIX 4.0, which has a couple
crucial differences from 3.2, pointed out by Lucas Hart.  Used the symbol to
eliminate problems in the select() and getpgrp() calls in ckutio.c, etc.
Tested on 3.2 OK, needs testing on 4.0.  20 Oct 96.

Added a few more #ifdefs for HP-UX 10.xx differentiation, built a new version
on 10.10 with no complaints (except for a couple "optdrivers", which are to
be expected).  20 Oct 96.

Tons of risky changes for VMS:

 . Rearranged CKVKER.COM because Hunter Goatley said that
   TCPWARE:UCX$IPC.OLB/LIBRARY had to come before SYS$LIBRARY:VAXCRTL.OLB/LIB
   otherwise the linker can't resolve the VAXC$ socket routines referenced in
   UCX$IPC.OLB.

 . Fixed various typos in CKVKER.COM, including one that killed execution
   for CMU/Tek (an extraneous left paren in a linker statement).

 . All sorts of casts-within-ifdefs, too numerous to mention, mostly in
   ckcnet.c, and involving select() and its friends.

 . Fixes from John Santos for VMS7.0/UCX4.1/DECC5.3 -- shut up the compiler
   about redefining bzero & bcopy.  socket_ioctl() pointer/mismatch/casts in
   ckcnet.c, linker complaints about several CC$$blah_blah_blah() routines,
   etc, resulting in nonfunctional TELNET.

 . Still doesn't build (for anybody) with CMU/Tek.  And Mike O'Malley is gone.

 . Reportedly there is still a problem inhibiting break-through writes
   (broadcast messages).  This is evidently because the ttbin() routine
   does not call the system at all if it is a network connection.  But it's
   been this way for a long time -- I hesitate to change it.  But on the
   other hand, maybe some of these items (flow control?) besides breakthru
   are needed.  Who's to say which are needed, and which will cause trouble
   if we try to use them?

 . On VAX UCX, Telnet connections would not go thru.  The TCP port was
   byte-swapped.  Didn't we just fix this???  Yes -- Bernie V took out the
   htons() call.  But he was using an Alpha, I'm using a VAX.  So I put
   htons() back for the VAX, kept it out for the Alpha.  Search for
   DO_HTONS in ckcnet.c.
    
 . Added a VMS-specific test to hupok() to skip asking for OK if running in 
   batch.  Should be harmless enough.  ckuus3.c, 20 Oct 96.

Result (after a lot of corrections) compiles and makes a Telnet connection
on my UCX MicroVAX.  Probably breaks everything else on earth.  20 Oct 96.

In VMS, typing Ctrl-Z to exit-warning prompt caused an unbreakable infinite
loop.  getyesno() was not allowing for EOF.  Fixed in ckuus3.c, 21 Oct 96.

The curses changes from Oct 19 lived up to their name, no surprise.  The
problem was, I moved code from a module that did not #include <curses.h> to
one that did, and so the prototype for tgetent() was causing all sorts of
problems, so I removed it for all but VMS with DECC -- and it might not even
be needed there	(yes, it is needed there).  ckuusx.c, 21 Oct 96.

I got sick of all the pointer mismatches, etc, coming out of the new SET TCP
(linger, keepalive, etc) support code.  For example, a certain Alpha with TGV
and DECC complains that getsockopt(...,&x) is being called with &x instead of
just x, EVEN THOUGH it's supposed to return its result in x (grrrrrrrr).  So I
made a compile time option, NOTCPOPTS, to make it all go away.  Defined
NOTCPOPTS for CMU/Tek (where they compile but don't work) and Alpha/TGV (where
they don't compile, even though they do on VAX/TGV).  We didn't have this
stuff before, we can live without it now.  SHOW FEATURES shows NOTCPOPTS if
defined.  Many modules, 21 Oct 96.  Tested the above on the aforementioned
recalcitrant system, and now it compiles and links just fine, and even makes
Telnet connections and transfers files.  Hallelujah.

Finally got the latest sources to build on VAX/VMS5.4/TGV3.3/VAXC3.1 (after
some help from Joellen with the CKVKER.COM file), and glory be, it can
transfer files without having to SET PARITY SPACE.  So maybe I fixed it.

Then again, maybe not -- two reports came in to the contrary only minutes
after the above entry; one applies to a VMS/UNIX serial connection, the other
to a VMS/VMS Telnet connection.  Many hours later... extensive testing and
analysis showed that the real problem was that VMS C-Kermit simply could not
receive files.  It could send just fine, but not receive.  Debug logs showed
incoming data packets badly mangled.  Comparison of a pre-weekend version of
ckvtio.c (when I made the parity fixes) and today's version turned up
virtually no differences outside of the parity-related code.  Close
examination of that code showed that in ttinc() I was using an unsigned char
variable where an int was called for.  And if ttinc() doesn't work right, you
might as well close up shop and go home.  But no, that was would have been too
easy...  Gradually, bit by bit, I backed off on the parity changes.  Now we
can receive files again, but need to SET PARITY SPACE, so we're back where we
were last week.  More hours later...  It seems that when a character comes in
that has its high bit set, and it is returned by ttinc(), netinc(), or
txbufr(), to ttinl(), it gets its sign extended, and so makes it look like
there was a timeout, causing ttinl() to fail.  And yet, there is NO PLACE
where any of these routines returns a character without ANDing it with 0xff or
0x7f.  Real full-width negative numbers are returned only as failure codes.
I'm beginning to smell a DECC rat.  Finally, I went through all those routines
and found all the places where they "return(c & 0xff);" (or whatever) and
changed them all to "return((unsigned)(c & 0xff));".  Now it works again --
even VMS-to-VMS.  21 Oct 96.

Applied some of yesterday's lessons to ckutio.c -- routines such as coninc()
and ttinc() that can return either a character value or a negative number
all need this treatment.  22 Oct 96.

Ditto for ckvtio.c -- put casts into contti(), coninc(), etc.  22 Oct 96.

Fixes to CKVKER.COM from Joellen.  22 Oct 96.

Updates to CKVKER.HLP, CKVKER.BWR, CKVINS.DOC.  22 Oct 96.

Made PAUSE/SLEEP, if it is interrupted by an ordinary character from the
keyboard, read one character (it knows at least one is there), so a succession
of PAUSEs won't all be interrupted by the same character -- this was causing
some scripts to fail.  Also, MSK does it this way.  22 Oct 96.

Fixed #if (__DECC_VER>=5000000) constructions on advice from John Santos on
(a) the format of the version number (= vvuuteeee) and (b) the fact that the
__DECC_VER symbol is not available prior to DECC 5.0, so a fat lot of good it
does.  22 Oct 96.

Hunter Goatley discovered that VMS-VMS labeled transfers resulted in the
transferred file being lost, oops.  My fault.  The edit of 22 Sep 96 was
slightly off-base.  ckvfio.c, 22 Oct 96.

Added a new command, EIGHTBIT, which is simply shorthand for SET TERM BYTE 8,
SET COMMAND BYTE 8, SET PARITY NONE -- I got tired of explaining to people
why they needed three commands for this.  ckuusr.[ch], ckuus2.c, 23 Oct 96.

BeBox DR8 needs alarm() definition removed.  New BE_DR_7 symbol created for
alarm() related material, and a separate makefile entry added.  ckutio.c,
makefile, 24 Oct 96.

Many statements of the form: "return((tn_sopt(WONT,x) < 0) ? -1 : 0);"
were turned into "if (tn_sopt(WONT,x) < 0) return(-1); else return(0);"
to allow the use of breakpoints.  ckcnet.c, 24 Oct 96.

Changes from Jeff to let the C-Kermit Telnet client talk to the BeOS DR8
telnetd, which is badly broken -- recovery from malformed subnegotiations,
etc.  ckcnet.c, 24 Oct 96.

A couple minor #ifdef and makefile tweaks for Digital UNIX 4.0.
ckcdeb.h, makefile, 25 Oct 96.

New CKVKER.COM and CKVKER.MMS from Joellen; allows multiple simultaneous
builds from the same source files into different target directories.
25 Oct 96.

With help from Lucas Hart, John Santos, Joellen, and info from Patty Chien,
was able to juggle #ifdefs to get successful compilation -- for the very first
time -- on just about every combination of DECC version and Multinet version.
The horrible problems that happened before all revolved around <sys/types.h>:
it was not being included, or there were conflicts between the Multinet
version and the DECC version, or it was being included twice, etc etc.

Added prototype for sleep() in ckcfns.c, needed for DECC versions prior to
5.2.  Tested with DECC 4.0, 5.0, 5.2, 5.3.  ckcfns.c, 25 Oct 96.

Added static char sccsid[] to ckcmai.c, which works with some versions of
SCSS "what" (e.g. on HP-UX) but not others (e.g. SunOS, because we don't
really use SCCS).  26 Oct 96.

Used my brain plus evidence from Peter Eichhorn and Chuck Fuller to figure out
what is going on with HP-UX 10.10 and curses -- the curses library has a
select() routine in it!  Whenever we call select(), we get the wrong select
routine, and C-Kermit hangs or dumps core.  Sent a report off to HP.  Added
additional debugging statements to curses-calling code in ckuusx.c; made sure
we were checking in advance for null pointers, etc -- we were.  The place
where it hangs is when printw() is first called.  ckuusx.c, 26 Oct 96.

Fixed a bad bug in \freplace() that had been there forever; namely, when the
match string and the replacement strings were different lengths, the result
string could be truncated (if there were no matches) or could have junk
appended to it (if there were matches).  ckuus4.c, 26 Oct 96.

Another #ifdef adjustment to ckcnet.h for DECC and VMS 7.0, because in
<strings.h> (which exists only for DEC C >= 5.2), bzero and bcopy are declared
only for OpenVMS >= 7.0, from Lucas Hart.  26 Oct 96.

Working on VMS C-Kermit problem with re-CONNECT-ing to a Telnet host that
had previously closed the connection.  This should open a new one, but it
never has.  Added debugging statements, tried lots of experiments.  Found
that various VMS routines, including ttchk(), nettchk(), ck_cancio(), 
contti(), etc, did not check for "connection not open" before calling the
system.  Each time I added one of these checks, I got a little farther, but
only to reveal another gotcha.  To be continued...  26 Oct 96.

Changes for BEBOX to ckcnet.h, to let it use the TCPIPLIB code.  27 Oct 96.

Hellmuth Michaelis at Hanseatischer Computerservice GmbH in Hamburg pointed
out that HP-UX 10.10 and above still have the old curses library ("HP curses",
the one that works) in /usr/lib/libHcurses.*.  libxcurses turns out to the new
UNIX95 (i.e. "Buzzword-1.0 Compliant") version, full of bugs.  Linking with HP
curses in HP-UX 10.10 and above should fix all the horrible problems on
unpatched HP-UX systems.  Makefile entries amended to do that; testing needed.
27 Oct 96.

David-Michael Lincke at the U of St Gallen in Switzerland said to remove
"LIBS=-lBSD" from the HP-UX 10.xx entries because "it is not required for
using sockets" [it used to be...] "The only thing it really does is give you
BSD signal semantics but at the price of messing up lots of other things -- a
library clearly to be avoided."  So I removed -lBSD from the 10.xx entries,
built and tested on 10.00 and 10.10.  It linked and executed just fine -- made
telnet connections, transferred files with fullscreen display, handles SIGINT
interrupts OK, etc, and is about 4K smaller.  Makefile, 27 Oct 96.

Tried the same on HP-UX 9.05, and it seemed fine, so removed "-lBSD" from LIBS
in the HP-UX 9.xx makefile entries also, with a comment to put it back in case
of trouble.  27 Oct 96.

Tried making an HP-UX 10.00 statically linked version, but I must not have
used the right magic -- it still comes up with "shl_findsym" and "shl_load"
undefined.  If it had worked, maybe we would have had one binary for all
versions.  27 Oct 96.

Changed the VMS version of rlog_ini() to lowercase the username, like UCX
does (since VMS usernames are uppercase, but case-independent), suggested by
Lucas Hart.  ckcnet.c, 27 Oct 96.

Amended some comments in CKVKER.COM at Lucas's suggestion.  27 Oct 96.

Lucas Hart reported that the VMS Kermit server was returning REMOTE DIRECTORY
(etc) listings with linefeeds between each line, but no carriage returns,
resulting in the infamous stairstep effect when (e.g.) MS-DOS Kermit was the
client.  Fixed {snd,nxt}{dir,del,etc} routines to put carriage return and
linefeed at the end of each line, and also reformatted the listings to be less
USA/DOS like; dates are now shown in Julian numeric format rather than with
English month names, <DIR> is now shown as (directory), etc, and I removed
extraneous blank lines and gratuitous spacing wherever I could.  ckcfns.c,
27 Oct 96.

Noticed that the VMS C-Kermit server, when executing REMOTE DIRECTORY, did not
(a) report that a directory file was a directory, and (b) did not strip off
the pathname from each file like the other versions do.  I fixed (b) in
nxtdir(), ckcfns.c, 27 Oct 96.

(a) required adding code to zchki() to report that SYS$BLAH:[USER]BLAH.DIR;1
is a directory (if it is, according to stat() -- I don't know the right
incantations to ask RMS, and evidently nobody else does either, according to
the comments in zchki()).  To check the results of stat() I use S_ISDIR(),
which is not only the proper way to do it, but also apparently the only
portable way -- and note that although VMS lists stat() as a POSIX.1 function,
and POSIX.1 says that S_ISDIR() is a macro, you can't check whether it is
defined with #ifdef because, at least in DECC 5.3, it is not a macro even
though it is there.  Note: I did NOT do anything about .DIR files in isdir(),
because isdir() is mainly used to tell whether its argument string is the name
of a directory that can be used in (say) a CD command.  But [USER]BLAH.DIR;1
does not fit that requirement.  ckvfio.c, 27 Oct 96.

Oops, S_ISDIR() is not defined in DECC 4.0.  I knew it was too easy...  It
is defined in DECC 5.0 and 5.3, so presumably also for 5.2.  It is not defined
in VAXC 3.1.  No way to test for VAX C 3.2. etc etc, #ifdef city, revisited.
See them in zchki(), ckvfio.c, 27 Oct 96.

Noticed that IF DIRECTORY DISK1:[FOO]BLAH.DIR;1 didn't work in VMS.  Made
IF DIR call zchki() for VMS rather than isdir().  ckuus6.c, 27 Oct 96.

Also noticed that you could tell VMS C-Kermit to SEND $DISK1:[FOO]BLAH.DIR;1,
and by golly it would send it -- the directory file itself.  The addition to
zchki() takes care of this.

Back to last night's project.  Discovered that part of the problem with VMS
C-Kermit issuing those "a blah connection appears to be open..." messages is
that it was never built to allow the mainline code access to the ttyfd
variable.  But there's no reason not to, except maybe that you can't really
use it for anything, so I added it.  ckcdeb.h, 27 Oct 96.  (But it didn't help
-- ttyfd is not getting set back to -1 -- but that's a good lead!)

So when I left off, I had VMS C-Kermit detecting when the remote Telnet host
broke the connection, but (a) it would not finish popping back to the prompt
until the user typed a character (a dead giveaway), and (b) you could not
CONNECT back to the host make a new connection.  I can't really list all the
changes I made, but they boil down pretty much to: (1) have all tt*() routines
in ckvtio.c check that ttyfd is > -1 before proceeding AND if it's not a
network connection, also that ttychn is not 0; (2) make sure that contti()
always returns appropriately, in its own insane way; and (3) in the CONNECT
module, if contti() has returned in a way that indicates the connection is
broken, call ttclos() to close our end of the connection and set ttyfd back to
-1, and so on, and have ttclos() and netclos() call ck_cancio() to make sure
all pending reads are canceled, so that a subsequent CONNECT command will find
the connection not open and therefore will open a new one.  It works in UCX
2.0 and various Multinets where I tried it.  The usual suspects, 27 Oct 96.

Replaced memmove() in ckvcvt.c with a stupid homegrown routine, to get rid
of DECC 5.3 warnings on VAX/VMS 7.0.  28 Oct 96.

Fixed \freplace() again -- it was not always null-terminating its result.
ckuus4.c, 28 Oct 96.

Peter Eichhorn discovered an obscure bug that had always been in the command
parser.  If you type "get" (to start a multiline-GET command), then if you
type a trailing space on the remote filename, then delete it, then type
return, the command parser ignored the whole thing.  cmtxt() is used to parse
the remote filename (since we can't parse it locally as a filename, and since
it might contain spaces.  This was never observed before, because this is one
of the few places where cmtxt() parses a whole line.  Usually cmtxt() is
called only after a keyword has already been entered into the command buffer
(e.g. "echo text").  It turns out the same bug affected ASK and ASKQ.  The fix
was easy -- in cmtxt(), just reset the pointers in the reparse case.
ckucmd.c, 28 Oct 96.

This made me look at GETOK for some reason.  It had similar problems, but
for a different reason.  Fixed in ckuus6.c, 28 Oct 96.

Mike Freeman reported that VMS serial connections don't work after last
night's changes; Carl Friedberg reported the same for LAT.  Evidently I had
failed to apprehend the significance of the schism between ttyfd and ttychn.
One must check ttyfd for positiveness on network connections, and one must
test ttychn for greater-than-zeroness on serial and LAT connections.
ckvtio.c, 28 Oct 96.

The "perror" to print the system error message was #ifdef'd away.  Terry
and several others suggested I put it back.  It seems to work fine -- I wonder
why it was I took the trouble to disable it -- there must have been a reason.
ckuus7.c, 29 Oct 96.

Changed rlogin_ini() to use the local user ID for the server user ID if no
server user ID was given.  In VMS, as before, it lowercases the the user ID if
it was obtained from the environment, but leaves it alone if user gave it.
Same treatment for terminal type, plus in VMS, if it ends with "-80" or
"-132", the width info is chopped off.  I added the -width chopping to Telnet
negotiations too.  ckcnet.c, 29 Oct 96.

Added Lucas's change to ckcnet.h, in which the third arg in the ioctl
prototype is "void *" for DECC, and left as "char *" for VAXC.  29 Oct 96.

I still don't know what to do about the conflict between our built-in ioctl()
and the one that DEC supplies in the RTL in VMS 7.0.

Fixed a typo in last night's rlogin changes (p = tolower(*p) should have
been (*p = ..., oops).  ckcnet.c, 30 Oct 96.

Another minor #ifdef correction to ckcnet.h for DECC vs VAXC in the prototype
for ioctl() (from Lucas H), 30 Oct 96.

Made HP-UX 10.00 ANSI compiler stop complaining about select() call in 
msleep() (args are "int *" in 10.00, but "fd_set *" in 10.10++).  ckutio.c,
30 Oct 96.

Figured out why HP-UX transfers over a local Ethernet are so much slower than
they should be (it's telnetd or the pty driver) -- see HP-UX section in
ckuker.bwr.  30 Oct 96.

The default initial dynamic packet timeouts were way too conservative so
I lowered them from 15 and 40 seconds to 8 and 15.  This was all too evident
if you had some paramaters set so wrong the transfer could not start -- it
would take *for*ever* to give up.  ckcker.h, 30 Oct 96.

Fixed a typo in ckuusx.c that wrecked non-TCP/IP builds (#ifndef should have
been #ifdef...).  31 Oct 96.

Fixed a typo in ckuus6.c that prevented successful builds when CK_RECALL was
not defined.  31 Oct 96.

A new revised, expanded, and fully tested section on DECservers and LAT for
ckvins.doc, thanks to many people for their help.  31 Oct 96.

Discovered that all those "#if __DECC_VER > blah" statements, etc, that were
added various header files are (as I feared) fatal to at least one C
preprocessor: the one on AOS/VS -- even though they are within VMS #ifdefs.
Because, of course, the preprocessor must look at all material that's inside
these #ifdefs to find the matching #endif.  Removed all #if statements; there
was one in ckcnet.h and one in ckcdeb.h, but now the VMS build procedure needs
to be changed to define a special symbol if the VMS version is 7.0 or higher.
1 Nov 96.

Compiled and linked successfully on PDP-11 BSD 2.11, but the data+bss had
grown by a few K and so now stdio didn't have any buffers and so i/o was
painfully slow.  #ifdef'd away a few more messages, buffers, etc.  While
trying to #ifdef away the XYZMODEM support, discovered a couple references to
XYZMODEM variables and symbols that were unguarded by CK_XYZ and fixed them.
ckcdeb.h, ckcker.h, ckcmai.c, ckuus3.c, ckuus7.c, ckucon.c, 1 Nov 96.

Defined NOCKXYZ for pdp11 in ckcdeb.h and rebuilt, but it's still 2K too
big.  Cut back on various sizes of things defined in ckcker.h...  Eventually
got it to build OK.  1 Nov 96.

Learned that the format of the PID string in the UUCP lock file in the "Linux
File System "Standard"" version 1.0 is different from the one in version 1.2.
Added Yet Another Ifdef to account for this, plus instructions in the makefile.
ckutio.c, 5 Nov 96.

In adding the QUIET and VERBOSE options to SET DIAL CONNECT ON or AUTO, I made
two mistakes: (1) I passed the wrong variable (dialcon rather than dialcq) to
doconect(), and (2) in doconect(), I did not restore the "quiet" flag
immediately after *each* return from conect(), so if an APC or autodownload
occurred, the quiet flag might have remained altered by SET DIAL CONNECT
command when it should not have been, resulting (e.g.) in failure to put up
the file transfer display.  Also, at Jeff's suggestion, removed "quiet" from
the list of reasons why screen() should return.  ckuus4.c, 5 Nov 96.

Received a new edition of CKVKER.COM from Lucas Hart.  Cleaned up the help
text a bit and added a section to define VMSV70 if the VMS version was 7.0 or
greater, so that ckcnet.h would know whether to #include <strings.h>.  Tested
successfully on 10 different VMS platforms.  5 Nov 96.

Fixed some more "pointers not assignment-compatible/argument-mismatch"
warnings from HP-UX 10.20 ANSI C regarding ctime().  ckutio.c, 6 Nov 96.

Fixed some typos in CKVKER.COM, 6 Nov 96.

Added additional conditionalizing for DO_HTONS in ckcnet.c, based on TCPware
trials, from Hunter Goatley.  6 Nov 96.

Added -DBIGBUFOK for Linux.  Most Linux systems nowadays can afford it.
makefile, 6 Nov 96.

Added some #ifdefs for localtime() prototype to please HP-UX 10.20 ANSI
compiler.  ckufio.c, 7 Nov 96.

Backed off on yesterday's change because it broke HP-UX 10.10, 9.0, and many
others.  ckufio.c, 8 Nov 96.

Changes from John Santos to CKVKER.COM to accommodate CMU/Tek on VMS.
9 Nov 96.

Changes from Jeff for Telnet negotiations to cover some cases that never come
up when we are a TCP client, but that need to be covered when we are a server.
ckcnet.c, 9 Nov 96.

Also from Jeff: A new command SET TELNET BUG BINARY-ME-MEANS-U-TOO { ON, OFF }
to let us adjust to Telnet partners that make the wrong assumption that
negotiating binary mode in one direction also enables for the other direction.
ckuus3.c, ckcnet.c, 9 Nov 96.

Hooked up HP-UX 10.00 to a V.34+ modem with RTS/CTS flow control at an
interface speed of 57600bps and transferred a bunch of files (Cisco 2511
terminal servers with bidirectional hardware flow control on the other end).
The connection itself was at 31200bps.  C-Kermit sent itself (the kermit
binary) at 4100 cps.  Later, on a 28800bps connection, it received a 1.2MB
compressed file at 2960 cps.  RTS/CTS was totally effective; modem lights
would blink in lockstep, and there were no retransmissions in either
direction.  SET CARRIER-WATCH ON works fine, too.  9 Nov 96.

Added "LNKFLAGS=-s" to sco32v5 entries -- the executable is huge without it.
Also added BIGBUFOK to CFLAGS, since most PCs running this OS are not going
to be low on memory or swap space.  makefile, 9 Nov 96.

Discovered that getyesno(), if given an invalid keyword as an answer (like,
say, "quit") would return rather than reprompt, and worse, it would not
restore the original prompt.  Fixed in ckuus3.c, 10 Nov 96.

Added "telnet bug binary-me-means-u-too" to SHOW NET.  ckuus4.c, 10 Nov 96.

Added an ULOGIN macro to CKERMIT.INI -- it's an all-purpose login macro for
use with services that want a user ID but not a password.  Made a sample
services directory that makes ample use of it.  Also made new sample dialing
and network directories.  10 Nov 96.

Updated many text files -- man page, various docs, etc.  10 Nov 96.

---6.0.129 Release Candidate 1---

Fixed a minor glitch I introduced into the SCO ELF build by adding -s to the
base SCO OSR5 build.  JP Radley.  makefile, 11 Nov 96.

Changed "Kermit name" of Plan 9 makefile from ckpker.mak to ckpker.mk to
emphasize its use with "mk" rather than "make".  Nigel Roles.  11 Nov 96.

Nelson Beebe reported that "make next" does not work for NeXTSTEP 3.3.
I added a new makefile entry and some #ifdefs to ckcdeb.h.  11 Nov 96.

Makefile changes for RT PC AIX 2.2.1 and for Ultrix 4.4-4.5 from Jamie Watson.
11 Nov 96.

Added explicit VOID to declaration of fxdinit() in ckuusx.c.  11 Nov 96.

Updated Ultrix entries from Jamie Watson, to account for Ultrix 4.4-4.5,
and give bigger optimization memory to MIPS versions.  makefile, 12 Nov 96.

Corrected assorted errors in cke192.doc noticed by Clarence Dold.  12 Nov 96.

Peter Eichhorn noticed that a lot of the compilation problems we were having
in ckufio.c were due to the fact that a variable was named tm, which is also
the name of a struct used in the same function, zstrdt().  Changed the name
of the variable to tmx.  ckufio.c, 12 Nov 96.

Nelson Beebe noticed that in IRIX 6.2, the argument to time() had to be cast
to time_t *, rather than long *.  ckutio.c, 12 Nov 96.

Some #ifdef adjustments from Jeff, various modules, 12 Nov 96.

Some fixes to SCO makefile entries to propogate MAKE value through nested
makes, and to add CK_WREFRESH to SCO 3.2v4.x and 3.2v5.0, from Robert Weiner.
makefile, 12 Nov 96.

Added comments about the default prompt containing the current directory
versus NFS-mounted disks when NFS is not responding to ckuker.bwr, suggested
by Peter Eichhorn.  13 Nov 96.

One of the switch statements wound up empty if TNCODE was not defined, noticed
by Ray Benoit when trying to build C-K for AOS/VS Calassic.  Fixed by moving
the #ifefs from inside to outside the switch() statement.  ckuus3.c, 13 Nov 96.

Ray Benoit noticed that AOS/VS C-Kermit server did not expand wildcards.
After adding a bunch of debugging statements to ckcfns.c and ckdfio.c, and
comparing with ckufio.c, I found that whoever coded iswild() for AOS/VS just
copied the UNIX version, and was not testing for AOS/VS wildcard characters.
Fixed now to test for '+' and all the other AOS/VS template characters
(+*-\^#).  Wildcard GETs work now with + and *, but not - because evidently
ckdfio.c's zxpand() does not handle it.  But "-" is equivalent to "+." so no
big deal.  ckdfio.c, 13 Nov 96.

New QNX makefile entries from Igor Kovalenko <infoh@wplus.net> in St Petersburg
(Petrograd/Leningrad), that work with latest Watcom C compiler, QNX 4.23, etc,
and also presumably with 9.x compilers.  Igor says the binaries should run
under QNX 4.21 and 4.22, but it hasn't been tested.  makefile, 13 Nov 96.

Merged in Lucas Hart's changes to support VMS 4.x and Wollongong 3.2.
Many modules, 13 Nov 96.  Also got a new version of CKVKER.COM from him.

Changed SET PREFIXING MINIMAL (and thus also "FAST") to prefix XON and XOFF.
So now these are unprefixed only if you explicitly unprefix them, or if you
SET PREFIXING NONE or SET CONTROL UNPREFIX ALL.  ckcmai.c, 13 Nov 96.

Fixes for Telnet terminal type negotiation from Jeff.  ckcnet.c, 14 Nov 96.

Fixed CLEAR command to return success code when it succeeds, rather than
always returning a failure code; reported by John Santos.  ckuusr.c, 18 Nov 96.

Changed prescan() to search the "take path" for the application file (filename
as first command line argument), if the filename is not absolute, just like
the TAKE command does.  Meaningful mainly only for Windows and OS/2, but in
UNIX and VMS (etc) this forces Kermit to look in the home directory if the
file isn't found in the current directory.  The search is done by cmifip(), a
command-parser function.  To use it, we stuff the filename into the command
buffer, followed by a couple CRs to make the function return, But first we
have to call cmdini() because the command-parsing data structures aren't set
up yet.  But that introduced all sorts of problems because cmdini also
executed the init file.  So I split cmdini() into two parts, cmdini() and
doinit(), calling each from the appropriate places, and it all seems to work
fine, at least in UNIX.  ckcmai.c, ckuus4.c, ckuus5.c, 19 Nov 96.

Added Cardinal modem type.  ckudia.c, 20 Nov 96.

Added ttres() to TRANSMIT, after it finishes and before it returns.
ckuus4.c, 20 Nov 96.

--- 1.1.8 ---

Merged in Jeff's changes: validation on TELNET NEW-ENVIRONMENT items, making
Latin-1 the default (i.e. "transparent") character set for Unicode-based
terminal emulators, etc.  ckcnet.c, ckuxla.c, ckuus7.c, 23 Nov 96.

Removed some unnecessary verbiage from some of the UNIX-specific version
heralds.  23 Nov 96.

Added a prototype for doini().  ckcker.h, 23 Nov 96.

Fixes to zchdir() for VMS -- preverify argument to chdir(), since calling it
with something that isn't really a directory causes a trap.  Also, whoever
wrote this routine (not me!) was writing into the buffer pointed to by the
argument string, tsk tsk.  Also... zstrip() was unconditionally throwing away
everything before the ":".  Instead of just returning an empty string in this
case, I changed it to return its original argument, on the assumption it is
either a device name or a logical name -- if it isn't, it'll be caught later.
Seems to work fine, e.g. with "receive LTA1:".  23 Nov 96.

New CKVKER.COM 1.14 from Lucas Hart.  24 Nov 96.

Added help text for SET XFER CRC, adjusted #ifdef for NOCSETS.  24 Nov 95.

Fixed a typo in the SCO 3.2v5 makefile entry.  24 Nov 96.

Defined BIGBUFOK automatically if "mips" was defined.  ckcdeb.h, 24 Nov 96.

Changed Ultrix entries to be called "ultrixblah" rather than "dublah"
("du" stood for DEC Ultrix).  Changed Digital UNIX entries from dec-osf32
and dec-osf40 to du32 and du40 (so now "du" stands for Digital UNIX).  Makes
more sense in the modern world.  makefile, 24 Nov 96.

Added SINIX-N MIPS V5.42 entry to makefile, built & tested it successfully.
25 Nov 96.

James Spath was reporting persistent core dumps from the NetBSD and FreeBSD
versions.  Turned out to be caused by the optimizer.  Removing -O from the
makefile entries fixed it.  Makefile, 26 Nov 96.

Added a couple #indef EXCELAN..#endif in ckcnet.c to allow compilation in
SCO Xenix 2.2.3, from William Bader, 26 Nov 96.

Fix to "set host blah:port", setlin(), which could dump core due to a
confluence of bugs in the C-Kermit code and the gcc implementation of strncpy.
This was the problem noted on Nov 26, not the gcc optimizer.  ckuus7.c,
27 Nov 96.

FreeBSD and NetBSD makefile entries put back as they were before.  Also, the
sco32v4netgcc entry was fixed to use gcc for both CC and CC2, to add
-DDYNAMIC, and to remove -traditional, -fpcc-struct-return, and
-fstrength-reduce (from William Bader).  Also, CK_ANSIC added to SINIX entry.
27 Nov 96.

Fixed some space-vs-tab errors in the makefile.  27 Nov 96.

Due to an #ifdef fumble in the last BSD 2.11 edit on Nov 1, the VERSION
command no longer displayed the copyright notice.  Fixed in ckcmai.c,
28 Nov 96.

--- 6.0.192 Announced, 29 Nov 96 ---
