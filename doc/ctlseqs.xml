<document title="Kermit 95 Control Sequences">

    <!--
    ////////////////////////////// README //////////////////////////////
    This is the source document used to generate ctlseqs.html and a few other
    related files. This XML file is *not* some variant of XHTML, even if some
    tags kind of look like XHTML. It is a custom XML document format
    and converter tool built specifically for this document.

    Why use a custom XML format for ctlseqs.html? For easier long-term
    maintenance. In particular:
      - To allow bulk changes to terminal type restrictions more possible
      - To make programmatic transformation of this documents structure
        more possible should it be needed some day
      - To make changes to the output *style* easier than with CSS
        alone
      - To allow conversion to other non-HTML formats in the future if
        there is a need.
      - To support generation of multiple different documents from a single
        source

    The document is organized thusly:
      - Reference sources: locations for various terminal and terminal
        emulator documentation
      - Badges and badge groups: identifiers for K95s various terminal
        emulation profiles
      - Outputs: definitions and stylesheets for the various documents
        that will be generated
      - Sections that make up the document itself

    About Sections:
      Sections are the basic blocks that make up the document. All content
      included in the output (aside from CSS) lives within a section.

      Sections can optionally have a title. Where one is specified, it will
      be included in the generated document as a heading or, if the section
      is nested within another section, a subheading. Sections can also be
      used without a heading simply to group content together within the
      document for applying common attributes. Attributes such as:

        - Which terminal types the sections content is relevant to (badges)
        - Whether the content described by the section has actually been
          implemented in Kermit 95
        - Which output documents the sections *content* should be included
          in.

      In addition to the above attributes a section has a role which
      describes what sort of content the section has. This can be one of:

        - text: general text, no special treatment
        - group: No semantic meaning, the section is just grouping other
          sections together. Depending on the roles of the other sections
          it contains, it may affect how they're rendered (such as less
          padding between section headings)
        - ctlseq or ctlchar: the section describes a specific control
          sequence or control character
        - parameter: Only valid inside a section with the ctlseq role,
          a parameter section describes a parameter for the parent control
          sequence or control character

      Sections with the ctlseq, ctlchar or parameter roles must have a
      control sequence specified, either via the ctlseq attribute, or by
      one or more child ctlseq elements. This specifies the control
      sequence or parameter/parameter-value the section is describing.

      A ctlseq, ctlchar or parameter section *should* also have one ref
      element for each terminal that supports it. The ref elements provide
      links to documentation where a terminals support for the control
      sequence/parameter is described, providing proof that that terminal
      does support it. In cases where references aren't available, the
      termsupp element can be explicitly used to state which real terminals
      support it.

      Ctlseq, ctlchar and parameter sections can still have textual content
      just like a regular section with the text role. This textual content
      should describe the control sequence/character or its parameters, what
      restrictions and behaviors apply, etc. But for some outputs generated
      from this file that textual content may be excluded.

    What are these badges and groups anyway?
      A badge is used to indicate terminal-type-specific behavior.
      Maybe a particular control sequence is only available if your
      terminal type is SNI-97801, or maybe it behaves slightly
      differently if your terminal type is SCOANSI.

      In K95, some behavior isn't assigned to specific terminal types,
      but specific *groups* of terminal types. A lot of terminal types
      behave *like* a VT100 (such as the linux console terminal). So
      rather than checking for 20 different terminal types everywhere
      VT100-like behavior is needed, it just checks if the current
      terminal type "ISVT100" - this means it actually *is* a VT100, or
      it's *compatible* with a VT100.

      The (badge) groups let that behavior be replicated here.
      Putting the "isvt100" group on a section applies all the badges in
      the "isvt100" group to that section. If the meaning of "ISVT100"
      in K95 changes someday to include an extra terminal type, all we
      need to do here is add the badge for that extra terminal type to
      the "isvt100" group and the badge for that extra terminal type
      will appear everywhere it needs to.

      The addition of the new Kermit 95 terminal type, and the need to
      have some reliable way to add it to all the places it needs to be
      in the ctlseqs.html document was the motivating factor in
      converting source of the document from HTML to XML.

    <!-- TODO  - Document K95s keyboard (what all the kverbs send)
               - Add reference links for everything in the designate character
                 set tables
               - Add reference links to and any new escape sequences found in:
                   - The VT320 manual: EK-VT320-RM manual (if/when it turns up online)
                   - The WY-370 manual
                   - VT240, VT340 manuals
                   - The Sun console (man wscons)
                   - The SCO console (?)
                        Documented here: http://osr600doc.xinuos.com/en/man/html.HW/screen.HW.html
                        Terminal support tags have been added, references have not
                        as that document lacks anchors
               - Consider moving VT52/H19 content into its own section
                   - Pro: - makes it easier to read
                          - xterms documentation does this
                   - Con: VT52 emulation has access to a lot of/most of the ANSI
                          escape sequences. Mixing it in with the ANSI emulation
                          makes this clear.
               - Add documentation and references for:
                   - Volker Craig (ckovc.c, 232 lines)
                   - ADM-3A (ckoadm.c, 292 lines)
                   - Hazeltine 1500 (ckohzl.c, 475 lines)
                   - AVATAR (ckoava.c, 542 lines)
                   - QNX (ckoqnx.c, 730 lines)
                   - Data General (ckodg.c, 1784 lines)
                   - Televideo (ckotvi.c, 2074 lines)
                   - IBM 31x1 (ckoi31.c, 2231 lines)
                   - HP (ckohp.c, 2997 lines)
                   - Wyse (ckowys.c, 5124 lines)
                 With the exception of AVATAR/0+, the code for all of these
                 is called from cwrite() followed by a return. If the terminal
                 has no emulation profiles (no ability to pretend to be, for
                 example, a VT100) then it should probably be covered in a
                 separate document. Perhaps it should be covered in a separate
                 document even if it *can* switch!
               - Add references to the designate character set tables
               - Check if the SCO "ESC xx" raw character thing (SCODPCC in the
                 VT520 manual) is implemented. If it is, then document it here.
                 SGR 10 & 11 seem to be related to this, possibly SGR 12 too
                 though thats only available to linux right now. I see code
                 which might be this feature, but it needs further inspection
                 and testing.
               - Update term references/termsupp elements for everything in this
                 spreadsheet
                 https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/dec_term_function_checklist.pdf
               - It would be neat if terminfo/termcap capability names/codes could
                 be stored against control sequences where they exist. This might
                 allow for interesting things like comparing K95 terminal
                 descriptions (as described by this document) with terminfo/termcap
                 descriptions, or generating a starting point for terminfo/termcap
                 descriptions from this document.

    <!-- References to similar documentation elsewhere. This helps to identify
         other terminals (or terminal emulators) that support a given feature,
         as well as provide additional information about that feature.

         Reference sources require the following attributes:
            name - this is what's displayed in the generated HTML document
            key - more on this later
            uri - a base URI for the reference
            uri-type - how the base URI is used to create links
            sort-order - order in which references should be displayed when there
                         is more than one

        References are added to a section using the <ref> element, which takes
        a single "src" attribute. The attribute is a combination of key and
        a value separated by a colon. For example:
            <ref src="wy370:20"/>
        The key must match a refsrc element below, and the meaning of the value
        depends on the uri-type of the refsrc:
            anchor: the value is combined with the refsrc uri with the '#' character
            prefix: the value is combined with the refsrc uri with no joining character
            pdf-page: the value is combined with the refsrc uri with the string '#page='
                separating the two. The value is also shown alongside the name in
                the generated document in brackets with 'p' in front of it.
                For example:
                uri: foo.pdf
                uri-type: pdf-page
                name: document
                key: x
                reference: x:123
                resulting URI: foo.pdf#page=123
                resulting link: document (p123)
           pdf-page-offset: This can be used to show the numbered page in the
                document. In the above example, if pdf-page-offset is 23 then
                the display would be "document (p100/123)"

            These tables attempt to show which control sequences are available
            for which of the terminal type emulations supported by Kermit 95.
            Only those control sequences that are actually implemented are
            listed here. These tables are <em>wide</em> so you'll want to
            maximize the window, and even then you will likely find yourself
            scrolling sideways.
        </p>
        <p>
            For ANSI-like, VT52 and H19 emulations, many control sequences are
            not restricted to any particular terminal type and so are available
            to all emulations even if the real terminal doesn't
            implement that control sequence. For a table of what the (some of
            the) real terminals <em>actually</em> implement, whether it's
            supported by Kermit 95 or not, see
            <a href="term-ctlseqs.html">Control Sequences by Terminal</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Links on control sequences take you to the relevant section in the
            main <a href="ctlseqs.html">Kermit 95 Control Sequences</a> document.

                is its block mode capability - the key thing that differentiates

            Whether a terminal appears here or not depends on whether good
            enough documentation can be found to provide references for all the
            control sequences it implements. The DEC VT320 is notably excluded
            here for that reason—no copy of EK-VT320-RM (the VT320 programmers
            reference manual) is available online.

            All of the information on this page was obtained by reading the
            available documentation for the listed terminals, so there may very
            well be errors and inconsistencies. If you spot one, log a bug
            or <a href="https://github.com/davidrg/ckwin/discussions">make a post

        <section role="text" title="Reading the Tables"
                 formats="html:term-ctlseqs">
            <p>
                In the tables on this page, each row represents a control
                sequence giving its name and mnemonic (if they're known) and
                control sequence. This is followed by multiple columns, each
                one representing a particular terminal (or terminal emulator).
                If the background color of the row is <em>orange</em>, that
                indicates Kermit 95 does not currently implement that control
                sequence.
            </p>
            <p>
                If an 'X' or an 'O' appears in one of the terminal columns, that
                means the control sequence represented by that row is supported
                by that terminal (according to that terminals' documentation at
                least). The 'X' means that K95s emulation of that terminal also
                supports that control sequence (if K95 supports it at all),
                while the 'O' means K95s emulation of it does not (or at least
                not without switching terminal emulation modes first).
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the VT100 supports <tt>ESC A</tt>, but only if the
                terminal is switched to VT52 emulation mode first. As a result,
                while both the VT100 and Kermit 95 support <tt>ESC A</tt>, K95s
                VT100 emulation does not.
            </p>
            <p>
                An 'O' may also appear in the case where K95 doesn't support
                emulating the terminal at all and as a result the code for that
                control sequence isn't marked as being available to that
                terminal emulation
            </p>

            <p>
                As these tables list all control sequences whether Kermit 95
                implements them or not, it serves to show how complete
                Kermit 95s emulations of these terminals are (or would be if it
                emulated them), and forms a kind of to-do list for completing
                any emulation that is not yet complete (or adding any emulation
                that is not yet present). At the bottom of the terminal columns
                you'll find the percentage of control sequences for that table
                that Kermit 95 implements.

            This document is a subset of <a href="term-ctlseqs.html">Control
            Sequences by Terminal</a>, filtered to show only currently
            unimplemented control sequences (and parameters) that are perhaps

            compatibility with other terminals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The criteria for inclusion here is dictated by the conversion
            program, in particular the <tt>todo_terminals</tt> setting, and any
            filter rules in the <tt>todoOutputFilter</tt> procedure. The
            current rules are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Must be supported by VT102 <b>OR</b></li>
            <li>Must be supported by VT220 <b>OR</b></li>
            <li>Must be supported by VT420 <b>OR</b></li>
            <li>Must be supported by both xterm and teraterm <b>OR</b></li>
            <li>Must be one of a few other misc control sequences that
                would be easy to implement
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The reasoning for the criteria is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>K95s emulation of the VT102 and VT220 terminals is very complete.
                It wouldn't take a lot to finish it off (though soft-fonts will
                be <em>hard</em> and so probably won't be done until graphics
                terminal emulation is attempted).
            </li>
            <li>K95 doesn't currently include a VT420 profile, but its around
                72% of the way to supporting everything it needs to have one,
                so it makes sense to try and target those things.
            </li>
            <li>Implementing <em>everything</em> that xterm supports would be
                a very large undertaking, but it seems likely that many of xterms
                features are rarely used. So it may be more effective to start
                with the xterm features that other terminals, like tera term,
                have also chosen to implement as those are more likely to
                actually be used in practice.
            </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
            This document attempts to describe the control sequences implemented
            by Kermit 95s ANSI terminal emulator. It is roughly modeled on
            <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html">
            xterms excellent ctlseqs document</a> to make comparing implemented control
            sequences easier. For quicker lookup,
            <a href="outline.html">An Outline of this document is available</a>,
            as well as a <a href="tt-ctlseqs.html">Table of Control Sequences
            by Terminal Type</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to 2025 there was no documentation on the control sequences supported
            by Kermit 95. This document was produced by reading through <em>several
            thousand lines of ANSI C</em> recording what appeared to be implemented and
            what, if any, terminal type restrictions applied to various behaviors.
            There is sure to be errors, and many of the descriptions are unhelpfully
            brief.
        </p>
        <p>
            Importantly, this document describes what Kermit 95 currently
            does (or <em>appears</em> to do) for a control sequence, not necessarily
            what it <em>should</em> do for a given control sequence and terminal
            emulation. There are no doubt bugs in Kermit 95s implementation of
            some escape sequences, and errors in this documents description of Kermit 95s
            implementation. If you notice any errors or omissions <em>please log
            a bug to have it corrected!</em> Its important to remember this
            is not documenting what real terminals do, just what Kermit 95s
            various modes do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kermit 95 emulates many different terminal types.
            Where a control sequence, or some specific behavior, is specific
            to one or more terminal types it is marked with badges such
            as these:
            <badge name="vt320"/> <badge name="wy370"/>.

            Anything not marked with a terminal-type badge is available under all
            terminal type modes, even if a particular control sequence was not
            supported by a particular terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where possible, links to applicable standards and terminal
            documentation are provided. This is usually on the same line the

            K95s implementation will not always match the associated standards
            or terminal documentation. This could due to bugs (in K95 or in the
            terminals being emulated), or simply due to K95s implementation
            being incomplete.

        <!-- ANSI-compatible, VT52 and H19 emulations -->

        <!--
        This section largely covers stuff implemented in vtescape() and cwrite().

        Certain emulations are handled elsewhere, such as hpterm and hp2621.
        These are implemented by the hpascii() function which is called by
        cwrite() fairly early on, and when hpascii() returns, so does cwrite()
        preventing execution from ever ending up in vtescape().

            iswyse (wy30, wy50, wy60, wy160):
                Handled by ckowys, wyseascii(). No escape without switching to
                another tt_type_mode. Nothing in vtescape() currently checks
                for an ISWYSE() emulating, eg, a VT100.

            ishp (hpterm, hp2621):
                Handled by ckohp.c, hpascii(). No ability to change tt_type_mode
                and does not call vtescape()

            isdg200 (dh210, dg217):
                Handled by ckodg.c, dgascii().  No escape without switching to
                another tt_type_mode. Nothing in vtescape() currently checks
                for an ISDG200() emulating, eg, a VT100.

            istvi (tvi910, tvi925, tvi950):
                Handled by ckotvi.c, tviascii() from which there is no escape

            qnx:
                Handled by ckoqnx.c, qnxascii().  No ability to change
                tt_type_mode and does not call vtescape()

            ibm31:
                Handled by ckoi31.c, i31ascii().  No ability to change
                tt_type_mode and does not call vtescape()

            adm3a, adm5:
                Handled by ckoadm.c, admascii().  No ability to change
                tt_type_mode and does not call vtescape()

            hzl1500:
                Handled by ckohlz, hzlascii(). This can call into wyseascii()
                from which there is no escape without switching to another
                tt_type_mode.

            vc4404:
                Handled by ckovc, vcascii() from which there is no escape

            xterm, k95:
                Not currently implemented


        For now this section is untitled because:
            1) The document *only* covers emulations implemented in vtescape()
            2) It puts everything one level deeper which messes up the CSS and
               document formatting.
        Eventually when non-ANSI emulations are described in this document, the
        CSS and likely document converter will need upgrading to handle this.

                       by hpLowerLeftBugCompat resource

                       This appears to be an hpterm escape sequence
                       ("Cursor Home Down") which we do implement as part of our
                       hpterm emulation.

                       xterm optionally implements it because apparently HP's xdb
                       ignores termcap and always sends it to send the cursor to the
                       lower left corner.

                       We can probably get away with not implementing it as users
                       who need this behaviour can just switch to K95s hpterm
                       emulation.

        <p>Kermit 95 supports the execution of Kermit commands via APC. As this could
            be hazardous, APC sequences are disabled by default and must be turned on
            with the slightly risky <tt>set term apc on</tt> command or the far more
            risky <tt>set term apc unchecked</tt>.
        </p>

        <p>With APC sequences on, the remote host can request the execution of any
            Kermit command except those considered dangerous, such as push, run, !,
            redirect, delete, rename, output, enable, disable, script and set terminal apc.</p>

        <p>The <em>unchecked</em> option removes the above safety mechanism allowing the
            remote host to run any Kermit command at all on your PC including those
            which could cause damage such as deleting files and disabling other security
            features.</p>

        <p>You should only enable APC support when connecting to hosts you trust, and you
            should think twice about enabling unchecked APCs. See
            <a href="https://www.kermitproject.org/onlinebooks/uck2ep2.pdf#page=278">page 278 of
                <em>Using C-Kermit</em></a> for more on this topic.

                differs from OSC 8 is that you can specify the type of hyperlink with both
                URI and UNC path destinations supported.</p>
            <p>The parameter <param-single/> specifies the type of link - a
                value of 1 indicates a URI to be opened in a browser (e.g.,
                https://www.kermitproject.com), while a value of 2 indicates a UNC path
                to be opened in the file manager or the application associated with the
                file specified. A value of 0 is used to terminate a hyperlink.
            </p>
            <p>The second parameter, <param-text/>, is the destination in
                wrapped in quotes.

            </ctlseq>
            <p>
                <tt>D...D</tt> specifies the setting or selection being
                requested - this usually consts of the final characters from
                whatever control sequence makes the setting or selection.
            </p>
            <p>For example, to request the current SGR selection:</p>
            <pre>DCS $ q m ST</pre>

            <p>And the response, DECRPSS, would be in the form</p>
            <pre>DCS Ps $ r D...D ST</pre>
            <p>
                The parameter <param-single/> in the response indicates if the
                original request was valid (1) or invalid (0) as described in
                DEC-STD-070. Despite what the VT320, VT420, VT510 and VT525
                manuals say, this behavior is indeed correct. The VT320 manual
                got it the wrong way round, and the mistake was never caught,
                instead being carried forward all the way to the very end.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the request was valid, <tt>D...D</tt> will contain the
                response.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the earlier example requesting the current SGR selection,
                Kermit 95s response might be the following if bold, italic, and
                underline were all on:
            </p>

                <p>
                    A real DEC VT520 has two conformance levels: VT100 mode, and
                    VT520 mode. So setting the conformance level to 62, 63, 64 or 65
                    will result in the conformance level being set to 65 giving you
                    a response of <tt>DCS 1 $ r 6 5 ; 1 " p ST</tt> if using 7-bit
                    controls. And if you set the conformance level to 61 (VT100),
                    a real VT520 will not respond to DECRQSS because a real VT100
                    wouldn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result you'll only get a response on a VT320 or higher,
                    and the conformance level will reflect the chosen terminal
                    type. The only part of this response you can actually change
                    via DECRQSS is the 8-bit/7-bit controls setting.

                If the display is in reverse video mode (DECSCNM), in Kermit 95 beta 7 and
                earlier this clears the foreground color, and ORs <param-single/>
                with the existing background color. The resulting background color will
                not necessarily be the same as value supplied as <param-single/>,

                With the addition of support for more than 16 colors, in reverse video mode
                it now sets the background color to <param-single/> while
                preserving the foreground color.

                Only two of these are currently implemented.
                <param-single/> = 6 turns off backwards compatibility mode,
                while <param-single/> = 7 turns it on. AT this time when
                enabled, backwards compatibility mode causes colors to be reset
                by SGR Select Primary Font and Display GL Control Characters as Graphic
                Characters.

                The response is the default background and foreground colors
                numbers separated by a space. The value of <param-single/>
                should be 0, 1 or 2. <param-single/> = 1 for the reverse color
                attribute, 0 or 2 for the normal attribute (2 should probably be
                the graphic attribute, but K95 doesn't do that currently).
            </p>
            <p>
                In versions of Kermit 95 supporting color palettes larger than
                16 colors, the current palette index will be returned exactly,
                so if a color > 15 is set, then a color > 15 will be returned.
                It is assumed that any application that sets a color outside the
                16-color range will handle receiving a color outside this range.
                Otherwise, for the best compatibility stick to 16-color or RGB values
                for <tt>SET TERMINAL COLOR TERMINAL</tt> when using ANSI emulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                In versions of Kermit 95 supporting 24-bit RGB color, if the
                default foreground or background color is a 24-bit RGB value,
                then the nearest color from the 16-color palette is returned
                regardless of the current palette setting.

                    This does not properly conform to ISO-8613-6 and is implemented
                    only for compatibility other terminal emulators.

                    Sets the background color to the specified color in the
                    current color palette (as set by SET TERM COLOR PALETTE).
                    Valid range is 0–15 for the aixterm-16 palette, 0–87 for the
                    xterm-88 palette, and 0–255 for the xterm-256 palette.

                <p>
                    Console builds of Kermit 95 (k95.exe, k2.exe) only support
                    the aixterm 16-color palette. If the current color palette
                    is not aixterm-16, the specified color will be looked up in
                    that palette, and then the nearest match in the aixterm-16
                    palette will be used instead.

                K95 does not currently differentiate between the standard and DEC
                private DSR control sequences. Using the DEC private control sequence
                only affects the response produced by <tt><param-single/> = 6</tt>.

                This lets you switch in and out of VT100 mode, and change between
                7-bit controls and 8-bit controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                A real VT520 at least, and the documentation suggests this is
                the case for older models too, can only switch between the VT100
                conformance level and its own conformance level. On a VT520,
                trying to set a conformance level of 62, 63, 64 or 65 will all
                get you 65. You get to choose between the lowest level (61) and
                the highest level for your terminal—the in between options are
                all the same as the highest level.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the conformance levels you're switching to here depend on
                which terminal type Kermit 95 is emulating.
            </p>
            <p>If Kermit 95 is emulating a VT320 or higher, you can query the
                state of DECSCL with with <a href="#decrqss">DECRQSS</a>

                The parameter (default 0) sets how many lines the screen should scroll up
                when a line-feed function is performed with the cursor on the bottom line.
                A parameter of 2 or 3 introduces a small "jump" when a scroll occurs, while
                a parameter of 34 clears the screen rather than scrolling. A parameter of
                0 initiates "wrap mode". In wrap mode, if a linefeed occurs on the
                bottom line, the cursor goes to the same character
                position in the top line of the screen. When any
                linefeed occurs, the line that the cursor moves to is
                cleared.

                While a real VT525 limits you to the 16-color palette for the

                DECATC only affects a separate table of colors that Kermit 95

                These colors are not used when attributes are turned off via

                entries in the table they cannot be set via the

                entries can only be changed via DECATC. The DECATC color table
                is reset on terminal reset.

                    Changes the RGB value for one or more colors in the color

                    pairs can be supplied separated by ';' to change multiple
                    entries in the color palette. Only supported in GUI versions
                    of Kermit 95.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <tt><param-single symbol="c"/></tt> component is the
                    color index to change. Valid values depend on which color
                    palette is currently active: 0–15 for aixterm-16, 0–87 for
                    xterm-88, and 0–255 for xterm-256. The first five values
                    above the range of the current palette (e.g., for the
                    xterm-256 palette: 256, 257, 258, 259, 260) set attribute
                    colors. See <a href="#osc-5">OSC-5</a> for more details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <tt><param-single symbol="spec"/></tt> component is a
                    color specification in the form supported by XParseColor.
                    Both the newer <tt>rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB</tt> and older
                    <tt>#RRRRGGGGBBBB</tt> formats are supported, where R/G/B
                    are hex digits (case doesn't matter). X11 color names are
                    also accepted and parsed case-insensitively. For more
                    information on this color specification, see the XParseColor
                    man page, while a list of X11 color names and values can
                    be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names">on Wikipedia</a>.
                    Other XParseColor formats such as <tt>rgbi:</tt>
                    and <tt>CIEuvY:</tt> are not currently supported.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the <tt><param-single symbol="spec"/></tt> component is
                    a '?' character then instead of setting a color for the
                    specified color index, the current color is returned in the
                    form of an OSC sequence suitable for restoring the current
                    value. The returned OSC sequence uses the same terminator
                    (BEL or ST) as the original query OSC sequence.
                </p>
                <p>For example, <tt>OSC 4 ; 1 ; ? ST</tt> will cause K95 to
                    send back <tt>OSC 4 ; 1 ; r g b : 0 0 0 0 / 0 0 0 0 / 8 0 8 0 ST</tt>
                    for the default RGB value of 0/0/128 for color index 1.
                    If multiple query parameters are supplied (eg <tt>OSC 4 ; 1 ; ? ; 2 ; ? ; 3 ; ? ST</tt>
                    then multiple responses will be sent back.
                </p>
                <p>If a color was set by name rather than an RGB value, then
                    when queried that colors RGB value will be returned;
                    Kermit 95 does not remember the original color name used.

                <p>
                    These values can also be set via <a href="#osc-4">OSC-4</a>

                    in the current palette (as set by <tt>SET TERM COLOR PALETTE</tt>).
                    For example, if the current palette is xterm-256, then

                    would set the underline attribute to red.

    <section toc="true" role="text" id="color" formats="html:document"
             title="Color Support in Kermit 95">
        <p>
            Prior to Kermit 95 v3.0 beta.8, Kermit 95 was limited to 16 colors
            (the 8 standard ANSI colors, plus the additional 8 "intense" colors
            from aixterm). Kermit 95 now supports being built with
            multiple distinct color palettes and 24-bit RGB support:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>aixterm-16</b> - The aixterm 16-color palette (eight standard
                ANSI colors plus their intense variants)</li>
            <li><b>xterm-88</b> - Xterms 88-color palette</li>
            <li><b>xterm-256</b> - Xterms 256-color palette</li>
            <li><b>xterm-rgb</b> - Xterms 256-color palette, with direct RGB color support enabled</li>
        </ul>

        <p> The first 16 colors are the same in each palette.
            You can change the currently active color palette via the
            <tt>SET TERM COLOR PALETTE</tt> command. This setting is primarily
            for the GUI version of K95 and affects:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How the terminal is rendered</li>
            <li>The range of color indexes available for customization via
                <a href="#osc-4">OSC-4</a></li>
            <li>The range of color indexes that can be set via
                <a href="sgr-38-ic">SGR-38</a> and <a href="sgr-48-ic">SGR-48</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As Kermit 95 does not store a palette ID alongside each color attribute
            (this would waste too much RAM), changing the active color palette has
            an immediate effect on the current contents of the terminal and the
            scroll-back buffer. Switching from a larger palette to a smaller one
            mid-session will result in incorrect colors being displayed. As this
            is just a rendering setting, switching back to the previous palette will
            imediately restore correct color for the terminal screen and scrollback
            buffer.
        </p>

        <p>
            The color related build options primarily affect the size of the
            data structure used for storing color information for each cell in the
            terminal buffer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>8-bits (2x4-bit colors: 16 color palette only)</li>
            <li>16-bits (2x8-bit colors: 16-color, 88-color and 256-color palettes)</li>
            <li>56-bits (8-bits for flags, and two 24-bit colors which can each store either a
                24-bit RGB value, or an 8-bit color (as above) in the blue channel).</li>
        </ul>

        <section id="rgbcolor" title="24-bit RGB support" role="text">
            <p>
                If Kermit 95 was not compiled with 24-bit RGB support, or the current
                color palette is not one with RGB support (something other than
                <tt>xterm-rgb</tt>), Kermit 95 uses color quantization to select
                the nearest color in the current color palette to 24bit RGB colors
                set via <a href="sgr-38-ic">SGR-38</a> and <a href="sgr-48-ic">SGR-48</a>.
                That palette color is then stored, rather than the RGB value.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Kermit 95 uses the same data structure for storing
                attributes-as-colors (special colors in xterm) as it does for
                storing color attributes in the terminal buffer, Kermit 95 only
                supports <a href="#osc-5">OSC-5</a> (Change special color number)
                when built with 24-bit RGB support as OSC-5 does not support
                setting color indexes, only RGB values.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help applications on the remote host detect 24-bit color support,
                Kermit 95 will automatically set the <tt>COLORTERM</tt> environment
                variable to <tt>truecolor</tt> on the remote host when making a
                telnet or SSH connection. In the unlikely event this behavior causes
                problems, it can be disabled for telnet connections with
                <tt>SET TELNET SEND-COLORTERM OFF</tt>. For SSH connections there
                is no disable option as SSH servers will usually reject this
                environment variable by default unless its added to <tt>AcceptEnv</tt>
                in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="customcolor" title="Customising the Color Palette" role="text">
            <p>
                GUI versions of Kermit 95 keep <em>two</em> copies of each color
                palette in memory: the active copy, and the saved copy. When
                Kermit 95 is launched, both copies contain the same data. At any time,
                you can change the RGB value in both copies of the <em>current</em>
                color palette with the <tt>SET GUI RGBCOLOR</tt> command, and
                the <em>active</em> copy of the current color palette only with
                <a href="#osc-4">OSC-4</a> or (for the linux terminal type)
                <a href="#osc-P">OSC-P</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the terminal is reset, the active copies of all color palettes
                are overwritten by their saved copies. This results in changes
                made via <a href="#osc-4">OSC-4</a> being undone without
                affecting changes made via <tt>SET GUI RGBCOLOR</tt>.
            </p>
            <p>

        <section id="consolecolor" title="Color in Console versions of Kermit 95" role="text">
            <p>
                Console builds of Kermit 95 (or custom 16-color builds of GUI Kermit 95)
                only support 16 colors max. This is a limitation in the OS/2 VIO Window,
                and the Windows NT/9x console host prior to Windows 10 v1809. This is
                stored as a pair of 4-bit values packed into an 8-bit integer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Console versions of Kermit 95 have no control over the appearance
                of these 16 colors; that is up to the console environment K95 is
                running under. Because of this, console builds of K95 do not support
                customizing the color palette via <a href="#osc-4">OSC-4</a> or
                <tt>SET GUI RGBCOLOR</tt>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To retain compatibility with software blindly expecting 256-color or
                24-bit RGB color support, 16-color versions of Kermit 95 still
                support the <tt>SET TERM COLOR PALETTE</tt> command and implement
                <a href="sgr-38-ic">SGR-38</a> and <a href="sgr-48-ic">SGR-48</a>.
                When the host tries to set a color via SGR-38 or SGR-48, that
                request is translated into something valid for the aixterm-16
                color palette.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a color index was specified for SGR-38 or SGR-48, then the
                RGB value for that color is looked up in the current color
                palette, then the aixterm-16 palette is searched for the
                nearest match to that RGB value. If a 24bit RGB value was
                specified for SGR-38 or SGR-48, then the aixterm-16 palette is
                searched for the nearest match to that RGB value.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the nearest match in the aixterm-16 palette is found, that
                color index is then stored <em>rather than the supplied index
                or RGB value</em>. To not waste memory storing color indexes
                the console environment can't actually display, 16-color builds
                of K95 only have 4 bits each for the foreground and background
                colors, making them incapable of actually storing color indexes
                above 16 or per-cell RGB values.
            </p>
            <p>
                16-color builds do not support <a href="#osc-4">OSC-4</a>
                or the <tt>SET GUI RGBCOLOR</tt> command as the color palettes
                are only used to get an RGB value to use for color quantization.
                K95 has no control over how the console host/VIO window renders
                colors, so the RGB values in the color palettes are never used
                for display; only to map indexes from a larger palette on to
                the smaller 4-bit aixterm-16 palette.

    <section title="Default Key Map" role="text" toc="true" id="keymap">
        <p>
            Kermit 95 includes keymaps suitable for each of the terminals it
            emulates. These keymaps specify what each key on the keyboard does;
            many keys just send themselves (the 'a' key sends ascii character
            \{98}, 'a'), while others may send either special
            <a href="#kverbs">Keyboard Verbs</a> whose definition may vary based
            on the current terminal type, or literal text including control
            sequences.
        </p>

        <p>
            In key definitions, where you see notation such as <tt>\{98}</tt>,
            that means send character 98 (decimal), which in this case is 'a'.
            You'll see \{27} (ESC) appear when a key (or keyboard verb) sends
            an escape sequence, for example.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to the terminal-specific keymaps shown int he table
            below (which can be modified with <tt>SET TERMINAL KEY</tt>), there
            are the additional <a href="#kmode">Special Keyboard Modes</a> which
            act as an overlay to modify the underlying terminal-specific keymap
            or user key definitions.

        <p>
            In addition to terminal-type specific keymaps, Kermit 95 has
            <em>Special Keyboard Modes</em>. When one of these is enabled, it
            acts as an overlay changing
            specific key definitions to be more suitable for a particular
            application or language:

        <p>
            Any key not defined by the current special keyboard mode, will fall
            through to the user key definitions, or the terminal-type-specific
            keymap.

        <p>
            Keyboard Verbs (kverbs) <em>do</em> something. They might perform
            some action within kermit such as searching in the scrollback buffer,
            jumping to bookmarks, switching to command mode, etc. Or they might
            <em>send</em> something to the remote host.
        </p>
        <p>
            When they appear in key maps, KVerbs start with <tt>\K</tt> to
            indicate that they're a kverb and not something else. Only those
            KVerbs that appear in the keymaps in earlier sections are covered
            below; for a full list of all kverbs and what they do, see the
            Kermit 95 users guide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strings sent by are given in C-Kermits notation:
            <tt>\{27}</tt> is character 27, <tt>\\</tt> is is the '\'
            character, etc.
        </p>

        <!-- KVerbs *not* covered here:
                ( k >= K_TVIF01 && k <= K_TVIPRTSCN || k == K_TVISEND || k == K_TVISSEND)
                ( k >= K_WYF01 && k <= K_WYSSEND )
                ( k >= K_HPF01 && k <= K_HPENTER )
                ( k >= K_DGF01 && k <= K_DGSHOME )
             As these are for emulations that are not currently covered in this
             document

    <section role="text" id="pcterm" toc="true" title="PCTerm Keyboard Mode">
        <p>
            In Kermit 95s normal keyboard modes described in the previous
            sections, pressing a key either sends ASCII-encoded text and control
            codes to the remote host, or performs some action within Kermit 95.
            Pressing the 'a' key sends ASCII character 97 ('a') to the remote
            host, pressing the left arow key sends ASCII characters 27 91 68
            (ESC [ D) for VT-style terminals, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The PCTerm keyboard mode does not work this way <em>at all</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the PCTerm keyboard mode, except for Ctrl+Capslock (which toggles
            PCTerm mode), Kermit 95 sends whatever keyboard hardware
            <em>scan codes</em> it receives from Windows straight to the remote
            host unmodified. The remote host receives a scan code on key down,
            and another on key up. As the scan codes are 8-bit values, this
            only works on 8-bit clean connections. PCTerm is available for any
            terminal type, but the remote host must understand PCTerm mode for
            it to work. PCTerm mode is not available on OS/2 as Kermit 95 is
            unable to receive key-up events from the OS/2 console.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, in PCTerm mode when you press down the A key on a
            regular US-English PC Keyboard, Kermit sends the byte 0x1E. And when
            the A key is released, Kermit sends the byte 0x9E. While the A key
            is held down, the byte 0x1E will be sent according to the key repeat
            rate. So holding A for a few moments may result in the bytes
            0x1E 0x1E 0x1E 0x9E being sent.
        </p>
        <p>
            This applies if multiple keys are pressed and released too. For
            example, if you press down A, then B, then release A then release B
            the bytes 0x1E 0x30 0x9E 0xB0 would be sent.
        </p>
