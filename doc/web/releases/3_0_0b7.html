<h2 id="breaking">Breaking Changes</h2>
<p><b>WARNING: This release changes a few default settings and paths!</b> In particular,
    the change to the location for storing SSH-related files (known hosts, private
    keys, etc) may require a one-off change to your k95custom.ini if you are
    upgrading from a previous C-Kermit for Windows Beta release. See the sections
    below before upgrading and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in
    GitHub Discussions or email
    <a href="mailto:ckw@kermitproject.org">ckw@kermitproject.org</a>.
</p>

<h3>Things to be aware of when upgrading</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Kermit 95 no longer opens COM1 by default. If you previously depended on
        this, you'll need to add <tt>set port com1</tt> to your k95custom.ini</li>
    <li>The mouse wheel now scrolls half a screen at time, rather than one line at
        a time. If you'd prefer to retain the old default, put the following in
        your k95custom.ini:
        <pre>
	set mouse wheel up none \Kupone
	set mouse wheel down none \Kdnone
	</pre>
</ul>

<h3>The Default SSH Directory has Changed!</h3>
<p>The default SSH directory in beta 7 has changed from <tt>\v(home).ssh</tt>
    back to <tt>\v(appdata)ssh</tt>, the location used by Kermit 95 2.1.3 and
    earlier. This means Kermit 95 may not find your known hosts file, or your
    identity (public key authentication) files after upgrading to beta 7.

<p>If you'd prefer to keep these files in <tt>\v(home).ssh</tt>, the same location used
    by OpenSSH on modern versions of windows, add the command set <tt>ssh directory
        \v(home).ssh</tt> to your k95custom.ini

<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>
    This release includes <em>14 download options</em> covering everything from
    Windows NT 3.50 to Windows 11 on all CPU architectures, plus Windows 95/98/ME
    and 32bit OS/2. To make finding the right version for your system
    easier, you can use the <a href="3_0_0b7_dlopt.html">Download Picker</a>,
    or you can browse the
    <a href="3_0_0b7_dl.html">list of all download options</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="new_features">New Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>SSH Port forwarding (tunneling) is now supported again in both
        the Direct/Local and Reverse/Remote forms. You can add forwards before
        establishing a connection with <tt>SSH ADD { local, remote }</tt> and remove all
        forwards of a given type with <tt>SSH CLEAR { local, remote }</tt>. As in past releases
        of Kermit 95, these commands don't have any effect on an already established SSH
        connection - this may be changed in the future.</li>
    <li>New command to allow removing individual port forwards (<tt>SSH REMOVE
        { local, remote }</tt>) - previously Kermit 95 only had commands to remove <em>all</em>
        forwarded ports of a given type.</li>
    <li>X11 forwarding is back. Turn on with <tt>SET SSH X11 ON</tt>, and set your display
        with <tt>SET TELNET ENV DISPLAY</tt></li>
    <li>The SSH backend has been moved into a DLL. On startup, K95 attempts to
        load the backend DLL provided the <tt>-#2</tt> command line argument has not been
        supplied. If no SSH backend gets loaded, you can load one manually with the new
        <tt>ssh load</tt> command. This allows K95 to load the appropriate backend automatically
        based on operating system (Windows XP or not) and presence of MIT Kerberos for
        Windows. This removes the need to manually shuffle around ssh.dll variants, and
        also means that alternative SSH backends not based on libssh can now be supported
        should anyone want to build one, opening the door to SSH on vintage windows or
        OS/2 systems.</li>
    <li>SSH is now supported on 32bit ARM devices (Windows RT) for the first time</li>
    <li>Initial very limited SSH agent support has been added. Libssh is currently the
        limiting factor here and SSH agent support in K95 likely won't get much better
        without significant improvements to libssh in this area. See the SSH Readme
        for more details.</li>
    <li>REXX support has been extended to x86 systems running Windows XP or newer. This
        was previously an OS/2-only feature. You can now run REXX scripts and commands
        from the K95 command mode with the <tt>rexx</tt> command, and REXX scripts run from
        K95 can execute any Kermit 95 command by enclosing the K95 command in single
        quotes (eg, <tt>'set parity none'</tt>). For full details, see the REXX section of
        the K95 manual: https://kermitproject.org/k95manual/os2k95.html#os2rexx. The
        REXX implementation is the current Regina REXX release. regutil.dll is included
        but note that the Console I/O Routines it provides are not currently compatible
        with K95. The rexxre.dll external function package is also included providing
        support for POSIX regular expressions.</li>
    <li>New command to turn the menubar on or off: <tt>set gui menubar visible { on, off }</tt>
        When the menubar is turned off in this way (rather than with the command line
        parameter), important menu items are moved on to the system/control/window menu
        (right-click on the title bar for the actions menu and a few other things):<br>
        <img alt="k95-sysmenu" src="images/sysmenu.gif" /></li>
    <li>New command to turn the toolbar on or off: <tt>set gui toolbar visible { on, off }</tt></li>
    <li>New command to turn the statusbar on or off: <tt>set gui statusbar { on, off }</tt></li>
    <li>New screen scroll kverbs:</li>
    <li><tt>\Kuphscn</tt> - Scroll up half a screen</li>
    <li><tt>\Kdnhscn</tt> - Scroll down half a screen</li>
    <li>IBM OS/2 support is back! It should work on IBM OS/2 2.0 or newer with
        optional TCP/IP support provided by IBM TCP/IP 2.0 or newer. No SSH or
        Presentation Manager GUI as in past Kermit/2 releases. Additionally:</li>
    <li>No PC/TCP 1.2 or IBM TCP/IP 1.2.1 support (no SDK license; the DLLs from
        K95 2.1.2 should work if you need it)</li>
    <li>No dialer yet (crashes when built with Open Watcom)</li>
    <li>No SSL/TLS support (can't be built with Open Watcom)</li>
    <li>No legacy telnet encryption (no longer useful, but may return in a future
        release anyway)</li>
    <li>Reimplemented the three checkboxes in the Dialers GUI settings page for the
        menu bar, toolbar and status bar. These options were new in Kermit 95 2.1.3
        but were not present in previous open source releases of the dialer as it's
        based on code from K95 2.1.2. Any dialer entries edited with the dialer from
        C-Kermit for Windows betas 4-6, or Kermit 95 2.1.2 or older, will have these
        checkboxes default to ON. Entries last edited with the K95 2.1.3 dialer will
        have these three settings preserved. Turning off the GUI bars in this way does
        so via command line arguments rather than the new <tt>set gui</tt> commands so they
        can't be turned back on with the new <tt>set gui</tt> commands.</li>
    <li>Added support xterms Bracketed Paste feature</li>
    <li>Most of the users guide has been revised for this release and is now included
        as part of the release. The <em>Kermit Security Reference</em> and sections dealing
        with installing and uninstalling kermit 95 are still waiting to be overhauled.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enhancements">Minor Enhancements and other changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>All executables (<em>.exe, </em>.dll) now have proper versioninfo resources</li>
    <li>Upgraded to OpenSSL 3.4 which fixes a number of bugs and security issues and
        will receive security fixes until October 2026. </li>
    <li>K95G no longer opens COM1 by default. If you still want this behaviour, add
        <tt>set port com1</tt> to your k95custom.ini</li>
    <li>The command <tt>set gui toolbar off</tt> has been renamed to
        <tt>set gui toolbar disabled</tt> to better describe what it actually does and to
        make room for new commands to turn it on and off. The previous syntax
        (<tt>set gui toolbar { off, on }</tt>) is still accepted for compatibility with
        existing scripts. <tt>set gui toolbar on</tt> still does nothing as it always has
        (disabling the toolbar is a session lockdown feature)</li>
    <li>The command <tt>set gui menubar off</tt> has been renamed to
        <tt>set gui menubar disabled</tt> to better describe what it actually does and to
        make room for new commands to turn it on and off. The previous syntax
        (<tt>set gui menubar { off, on }</tt>) is still accepted for compatibility with
        existing scripts. <tt>set gui menubar on</tt> still does nothing as it always has
        (disabling the menubar is a session lockdown feature)</li>
    <li>Implemented the <tt>set ssh identity-file</tt> command</li>
    <li>Added new command <tt>set ssh directory</tt> which allows you to set the default
        location where K95 looks for user known hosts and identity files.</li>
    <li>The default SSH directory has changed from <tt>\v(home).ssh</tt> back to
        <tt>\v(appdata)ssh</tt></li>
    <li>The <tt>ssh key</tt> commands will now default to opening or saving keys in the
        SSH directory.</li>
    <li>The <tt>skermit</tt> command now has help text</li>
    <li>The default mouse wheel configuration has changed:</li>
    <li>Wheel up/down now scrolls up/down half a screen (like PuTTY) rather than a
        single line. This provides better much speed than a line at a time with
        better usability than a screen at a time.</li>
    <li>Shift+Wheel up/down now scrolls up/down one line</li>
    <li>Improve exit time when the console version (k95.exe) is just being run to show
        usage information (<tt>k95.exe -h</tt> or <tt>k95.exe --help</tt>). Previously K95 would
        pause for about 5 seconds after printing usage information before returning
        you to the shell.</li>
    <li>Fixed the <tt>telnet.exe</tt> and <tt>rlogin.exe</tt> stubs - these now behave as in K95<br />
        2.1.3</li>
    <li>Added the <tt>ssh.exe</tt>, <tt>ftp.exe</tt> and <tt>http.exe</tt> stubs that were included in
        K95 2.1.3 </li>
    <li><tt>iksdnt.exe</tt> is now included.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fixed_bugs">Fixed bugs</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fix <tt>fopen</tt> causing a crash. This issue seems to have come in some recent
        version of the Microsoft C Runtime.</li>
    <li>Fix hitting backspace in an empty search-in-buffer crashing</li>
    <li>Fix <tt>pty dir</tt> (or trying to run anything else that isn't a valid program)
        causing a crash</li>
    <li>Fixed POTS modem support not being available on NT 3.50</li>
    <li>Fixed OpenSSL libraries not being included in the ARM32 distribution</li>
    <li>Fixed \Kexit (Alt+x by default) not updating the state of the associated
        toolbar button</li>
    <li>Fix the SSH global known hosts file not being set to something sensible
        on windows. It's now set to the value used by past Kermit 95 releases by
        default: <tt>\v(common)ssh\known_hosts2</tt></li>
    <li>Fixed generation of 4096 RSA SSH keys</li>
    <li>Fixed stdout parameter not working correctly</li>
    <li>Fixed a pair of issues in the OS/2 NetBIOS implementation which has likely
        been totally broken since Kermit 95 v1.1.17:</li>
    <li><tt>SET HOST</tt> doing nothing for NetBIOS connections</li>
    <li>NetBIOS name not being correctly padded when making a connection to
        a NetBIOS Server</li>
    <li>Fixed emacs turning off mouse reporting when started</li>
    <li>Fixed K95G hanging when closing the window or using File-&gt;Exit with when
        a connection is active and GUI dialogs are turned off</li>
    <li>Fixed K95 bug 797: Dialer generated connection scripts will no longer include
        <tt>SET LOGIN PROMPT</tt> or <tt>SET LOGIN PASSWORD</tt> commands if those fields do not
        have a value as this broke the use of the standard login.ksc script.</li>
    <li>Fixed K95 bug 770: When editing an FTP entry in the dialer the general settings
        page doesn't load the port number causing it to be cleared on save.</li>
    <li>Fixed <tt>TYPE</tt> command error "The /HEIGHT switch is not supported without /GUI"
        when the <tt>/HEIGHT</tt> switch has not been supplied.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="src_changes">Other Source Changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a selection of build warnings, and improved compatibility with the
        Open Watcom compiler.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="issues">Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>32bit x86 K95 may crash on 64bit systems that have the 64bit version of
        MIT Kerberos for Windows installed. Use the 64bit version of K95 instead
        if you experience this problem (or install the 32bit version of KFW)</li>
    <li>When launching the dialer you may get an error about ctl3d32.dll - if
        you do, run ctl3dins.exe to install it</li>
    <li>The dialer may fail to start on some systems</li>
    <li>On the original retail release of Windows 95 (possibly all versions of
        Windows 95), the GUI version of C-Kermit constantly steals focus and
        performs poorly. The solution at this time is to run the console version,
        k95.exe</li>
    <li>The dialer is not currently available on Windows NT 3.50 - this may be
        corrected in a future release</li>
    <li>Networking is broken on Windows NT 3.10 - this <em>may</em> be corrected
        in a future release.</li>
</ul>
