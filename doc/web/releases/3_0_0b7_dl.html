  Kermit 95 3.0.0 Beta 7 Download Options</h1>
<hr>
<h2 id="install">Installing and Running</h2>

<p>
  Download and unzip it somewhere convenient and run <tt>k95g.exe</tt>.
  If it doesn't run, you may need to download and install the <u>Visual C++
  Redistributable</u> that goes with the package you downloaded and the
  Windows version you're running. If you get an error about ctl3d32.dll, run
  <tt>ctl3dins.exe</tt> to install it.
</p>

<h2 id="download">Download</h2>

<p>If the tables below are a bit much, you can try the
  <a href="3_0_0b7_dlopt.html">Download Picker</a> to find the right download
  option for your operating system and CPU.
</p>

<h3 id="modern">For Windows XP Service Pack 3 <em>or newer</em> with an x86 or ARM CPU</h3>
<p>
  Please note that The Kermit Project does not currently have access to any
  Windows-compatible ARM hardware to test on, so only very limited support can
  be provided. If you encounter a problem on ARM that does not exist on x86
  then <em>please report it</em>.

<p>
  Pathworks32 support is only available in the 32bit x86 version. ARM versions
  lack Kerberos support. The dialer is also unavailable in ARM builds, though
  you <em>may</em> be able to run the x86 version of the dialer under emulation.

<h3 id="os2">For 32bit IBM OS/2</h3>
<p>For 32-bit IBM OS/2 2.0 or newer. Optional TCP/IP support requires
  IBM TCP/IP 2.0 or newer, or IBM Internet Connection. Extract to a temporary
  location and run setup.exe to install.</p>
<p>This is the first open-source Kermit 95 release to feature OS/2 binaries. If
  you encounter any issues, please report it here on github either by starting
  a discussion or logging an issue so it can be fixed. If you're using this
  successfully it would be <
  a href="https://github.com/davidrg/ckwin/discussions">great to hear about it</a>
  too! Knowing the OS/2 version has users helps to prioritize future work on it.</p>

<p>No SSH backend is available for OS/2 at this time, so you'll see a message
  saying that no compatible SSH backend could be loaded - this is normal.
  Additionally, TLS/SSL is no longer supported on OS/2 and the dialer is not
  currently available due to an unidentified issue with Open Watcom.</p>

<h3 id="vintage">For Vintage PCs with an x86 CPU (Windows 9x/ME, Windows NT 3.5x/4.0, 2000/XP pre-SP3)</h3>
<p>
  Two feature-reduced versions are provided for x86 PCs running version of Windows
  older than Windows XP SP3. These lack SSL/TLS and SSH support as the required
  3rd party libraries no longer support such old versions of Windows or the compilers
  required to target them. They are otherwise functionally equivalent to C-Kermit
  on modern windows with the same terminal emulations and unencrypted connectivity
  options.

<h3 id="risc-nt">For Vintage Workstations/Servers using a non-x86 CPU (Alpha, MIPS, PowerPC, Itanium)</h3>
<p>
  These builds are for computers that are not PCs and won't run on anything
  with an x86 compatible processor.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that the Kermit Project currently lacks access to Windows
  compatible Itanium hardware so only very limited testing could be done
  on the Itanium build.

<h3 id="src">Source Code</h3>
<p>
  Kermit 95 is licensed under the 3-clause BSD license. To build
  it Visual C++ is recommended - <em>any</em> retail copy should work along
  with recent free/community editions. Some features will be automatically
  disabled when building with older compilers so newer is better unless
  you're targeting vintage computers. OpenWatcom 1.9 is supported though
  only with a feature set similar to the Vintage Windows builds
  (no ssl/ssh/pty/etc). GCC/MinGW should work too, but it is not recommended.
