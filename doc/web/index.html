    for <a href="screenshots.html">nearly all</a> 32bit and 64bit releases of
    Microsoft Windows, as well as 32bit IBM OS/2. Kermit 95 is the official
    Windows and OS/2 port of C-Kermit
    <a href="https://kermitproject.org/ckw10beta.html">from the Kermit Project</a>
</p>

<p>
    The latest <a href="#nature">stable</a> release is: 3.0 Beta 7 (27 January 2025).

<h2 id="doc">Documentation</h2>
<p>Three versions of the Kermit 95 manual are currently available online in addition
    to being packaged with Kermit 95:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="current/">Kermit 95 v3.0 - latest stable release</a> (3.0.0 beta 7 currently)</li>
    <li><a href="dev/">Kermit 95 latest development build</a> - may discuss features and details that are not available yet</li>
    <li><a href="https://kermitproject.org/k95manual/">Kermit 95 v2.1.3</a> - the last commercial release from 2003</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The Kermit 95 manual primarily covers details unique to Kermit 95 such as
    its terminal emulator and SSH client. For information on its command
    interface, telnet client and other aspects it shares with C-Kermit, see
    <a href="https://www.kermitproject.org/uckindex.html">The C-Kermit Documentation</a>
</p>

<p>
    For information on the control sequences supported by Kermit 95, see the
    draft <a href="dev/ctlseqs.html">Kermit 95 Control Sequences</a> document.
    Note that <em>this document covers the next release of K95, not the current
    one!</em> If you need to know what control sequences are supported in
    beta 7, you can find a copy of this file in your DOCS folder.

<h2 id="nature">Nature of the Current Release</h2>
<p>
    While recent Kermit 95 releases have carried the "beta" label, they have in
    practice been stable feature releases. They continue to carry the beta label
    only because:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>C-Kermit v10.0, on which Kermit 95 is based, is still in beta (though
        the last few beta releases have only been addressing Unix/Linux/OpenVMS
        portability concerns).</li>
    <li>Kermit 95 v3.0 is not yet at feature parity with 2.1.3, though it isn't
        far off now and the remaining missing features are becoming increasingly
        esoteric.</li>
    <li>There are a few terminal emulation features that have become common over
        the last 20 years which Kermit 95 v3.0 should probably support (24bit
        color, alternate screen buffer, and left/right margins to name a few).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Because the last "stable" release was in 2003 and isn't freely available (or
    particularly usable in 2025 due to changing encryption algorithms), Kermit 95
    is currently in a kind of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_beta">perpetual beta</a>
    development stage. If the latest release meets you needs it
    isn't worth waiting for the beta tag to disappear - the latest beta releases
    are already more stable last stable commercial release, and the beta tag may
    still be around for another year or three depending on how much free time the
    projects single developer has.
</p>

<h3 id="dialer">The Dialer</h3>
<img src="current/dialer.gif" alt="The Dialer"/>
<p>
    The "Dialer" as included in Kermit 95 2.1.3 and earlier is still included
    with Kermit 95 v3.0 where possible, but it should now be considered a
    deprecated feature. It's not going to go away, but its also not going to get
    much in the way of enhancements or new features. It's there if you
    <em>need</em> it, but you're better off writing scripts or macros to save
    connection details (see the
    <a href="https://www.kermitproject.org/ckwhowto.html">K95 How-To</a> for an
    example macro).
</p>
<p>
    The dialer is trapped in the 90s by the frameworks it was built with, so it
    is not possible to build it for x86-64, Itanium, ARM32 or ARM64. As a result
    it's not included with the Itanium, ARM32 or ARM64 versions of Kermit 95.
</p>
<p>
    A new replacement will be developed eventually (it is in fact already more
    than half built), but this likely won't appear until some release after
    K95 v3.0. When it does appear, the dialer will receive one final upgrade to
    support exporting its connections to a format its replacement can understand.
