<dt><b><i>Is Kermit 95 Buzzword-1.0 Compliant?</i></b></dt>

<dd>Most likely.  It is
<a href="year2000.html">Year-2000 Compliant</a>,
<a href="euro.html">Euro Compliant</a>,
it uses all the latest open security standards and libraries.
It implements numerous open Internet protocols.
It is Common Off The Shelf commercial software (COTS) and
therefore automatically complies with most procurement rules.  It is
approved for export to all but the seven embargoed countries.  For vendor

<dt><a name="docs"><b><i>What exactly is the documentation for Kermit
95?</i></b></a></dt>

<dd>Unlike most other Windows-based communication software, K95 is not a
Windows-only product, but just one of a suite of similar programs for many
platforms: Linux, AIX, VMS, Solaris, etc.  Collectively, these programs are
called <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html">C-Kermit</a> (a
Kermit program written in the C programming language).  Most of the features
of these programs are shared and identical across all platforms.  These
features are documented in:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ck60manual.html"><cite>Using C-Kermit</cite></a></dt>

<dd>A 622-page book describing C-Kermit 6.0 (December 1996) and the
platform-independent aspects of the concurrent version of K95 (1.1.8)
including the command language, serial and network connections, file transfer,
client/server operation, character set conversion, and script writing for
automation, plus sections on troubleshooting, tutorials on data
communications, and tons of reference material.  <i>Until a new edition is
published, this book remains the fundamental reference for the command
and scripting language of C-Kermit and Kermit 95.</i>  You can also find
a scripting tutorial with lots of examples
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95scripts.html">HERE</a>.

<p>

<dt><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit70.html"><cite>C-Kermit 7.0 Supplement</cite></a></dt>

<dd>Thorough documentation of the new features of C-Kermit 7.0 (January 2000)
and the platform-independent aspects of K95 1.1.17, which was the first
version to include secure authentication and encryption, and in which the
command language was greatly extended by the addition of "switches" (command
modifiers), and which was the first version to support Unicode (the Universal
Character Set), plus other changes too numerous to list here.

<p>

<dt><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit80.html"><cite>C-Kermit 8.0 Supplement</cite></a></dt>

<dd>Thorough documentation of the new features of C-Kermit 8.0 (February 2002)
and the platform-independent aspects of K95 2.1, principally the new FTP, SSH,
and HTTP clients or interfaces, plus tons of scripting improvements.

</dl>
<p>

At some point a new edition of <i>Using C-Kermit</i> will be issued,
incorporating the new material.

<p>

Then, each major C-Kermit platform (Unix, VMS, Windows, ...) has its own
<i>platform-specific</i> manual.  <b>The manual for Kermit 95</b> is included
with K95 itself, and is accessible from Kermit 95 by:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on "K95 Manual" on your desktop or in your Start menu depending
on your choices when you installed K95.

<li>Clicking on "Kermit 95 Manual" in the Help menu of K95G (the GUI version
of Kermit 95) or the Dialer.

<li>Giving the "manual" command at the <tt>K-95&gt;</tt> prompt.
</ul>
<p>
The Kermit 95 manual concentrates on the Dialer (how to graphically
set up and launch connections) and the Terminal Emulator (terminal types,
scrollback, key mapping, colors, local printing, character sets, etc).

<p>

In addition to the K95 manual, K95 also includes a great deal of other
documentation, including the C-Kermit 7.0 and 8.0 manual supplements, linked
to from the K95 manual.  You can also find a brief tutorial for K95
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95tutor.html">HERE</a> and another for
C-Kermit <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95tutor.html">HERE</a>.

<p>

Those who purchased shrink-wrapped copies of K95 through version 1.1.17
received a printed copy of <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>.  Those who purchased
shrinkwrapped copies of K95 1.1.20 received a PDF version of the book on
CDROM.  Due to renegotiated agreements between publishers, the new Kermit 95
2.1 package (January 2003) does not include the PDF version of <cite>Using
C-Kermit</cite>, but it does include a license key to let you download it
(note: this applies ONLY to owners of the K95 2.1 shrinkwrap).  Electronically
delivered versions of K95 do <i>not</i> include the <cite>Using
C-Kermit</cite> book because:

<p>
<ol>
<li>It would triple the size of the download;
<li>It would increase the price, since each copy of the book (printed or
electronic) must be paid for;
<li>The new GUI version of K95 does not require users to know the command
language for normal operation.
</ol>
<p>

This is the primary reason that the cost of the electronically delivered
version of K95 is so low.  The shrinkwrapped version costs more.

<p>

It is expected that the PDF version of <i>Using C-Kermit</i> will also be
available for purchase as an "e-book" from the publisher, Digital Press, or an
authorized agent; the details are not yet available as of this writing
(January 2003).

<dt><a name="os2"><b><i>What's going on with the OS/2 version?</i></b></a></dt>

<dd>K95 2.1.2 <i>is</i> available for IBM OS/2 3.0 and later with certain
restrictions: Console only (no GUI); no SSH, no Kerberos.  K95 1.1.21 and
2.0 were not available for OS/2, but we did succeed in building version 2.1.2
for OS/2, and the Kermit 95 2.1 shrinkwrap package includes the OS/2 version.

<p>

<dt><b><i>Why isn't Kermit 95 free?</i></b>

<dd>Kermit 95 is developed, documented, and supported by full-time computer
professionals at Columbia University's nonprofit
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">Kermit Project</a>.  Revenue from
Kermit 95 sales and licenses is the only source of funding for its continued
development and support.  Paying for Kermit 95 gives you the right to the
time, attention, support, and respect of Kermit professional staff, which is
something you can't count on with free software nor,
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/tsreviews.html">as some of our users
tell us</a>, with much commercial software either.

<p>

<dt><b><i>Why is the product (still) called Kermit 95?</i></b>

<dd>All Kermit Project software has "Kermit" in its name.  Kermit 95 was
originally written in 1995 for Windows 95, and was therefore given the obvious
name.  However, unlike Microsoft, we chose to stick with the original name as
new versions came out because it's quite difficult to refer to a product
generically, regardless of version, when each version has a different name.
Those who feel that the "95" in "Kermit 95" dates it should think of the "95"
as a part number or model designation rather than a year or version number,
and of K95 as a faithful and effective tool in the spirit of the similarly
named P38 (Army tool for opening C-rations).

<p>

As for "Kermit"...  This name was chosen on a whim back in 1981, before we had
any idea that Kermit protocol or software would ever escape the bounds of
Columbia University or remain current and popular for decades.  The whim, in
turn, was based on <i>(a)</i> a Muppets calandar on the wall when we were
searching for a name, and <i>(b)</i> the fact that some of us had small
children addicted to The Muppet Show.  Although a name like "Kermit" might
have certain drawbacks in today's fast-paced, high-powered software
marketplace, it also has (we think) a certain charm and simplicity: It's easy
to say, easy to spell, and utterly lacking in hyperbole and condescension.
But if you prefer, feel free to refer to K95 as:

</blockquote>

<p>
<dt><b><i>Can I use MS-DOS Kermit instead of Kermit 95?</i></b>

<dd>Under certain conditions, yes, but not for TCP/IP connections, not with
Plug-n-Play or PCMCIA modems, not with Winmodems or RPI modems, not with ISDN
modems, not with nonstandard communication ports, not with devices that are
owned by TAPI, etc.  Even then, remember it is a DOS program, not a Windows or
OS/2 program, and can not take advantage of, or access, special features of
Windows or OS/2 -- long filenames, the mouse, the clipboard, secure
connections, etc.  If it works for you, meets your requirements, and requires
no technical support then by all means use it on your own PC or within your
company, but remember, <i>you can't furnish MS-DOS Kermit to customers or
clients without a license, any more than you could K95 or C-Kermit.</i>

<p>

<dt><b><i>Do Kermit 95 and the Dialer work in all 32-bit varieties of
Windows?</i></b>

<dd>Yes, except for Windows CE (Pocket PC).  The same executables run on
Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, and XP on Intel (PC) architecture.  In previous
releases, K95 was also available for Windows NT on the Alpha and PowerPC
architectures, but those Windows versions have been discontinued.

<p>

<dt><b><i>Why not Windows CE or Pocket PC?</i></b>

<dd>Because Windows CE and Pocket PC do not offer the full range of Win-32
APIs.  Many of those that are missing are required by Kermit 95.

<p>

<dt><b><i>Can K95 be used with speech and Braille devices?</i></b>

<dd>Kermit 95 should be compatible with any speech or
Braille device that can be used in a Console or GUI window.
Typical settings are:

<p><pre>
  set bell audible                     ; Make sure Ctrl-G is audible
  set terminal margin-bell on 72       ; Margin bell like typewriter
  set terminal statusline off          ; For scroll detection
  set terminal screen-update smooth    ; Or "fast" - depends on screen reader
  set terminal screen-optimization on  ; This is the default anyway
  set terminal mouse off               ; Might be required by some readers
</pre>
<p>

In addition, certain keys might need to be set to <tt>\Kignore</tt>, so they
can be used as controls for the screen reader or Braille software.  Depending
on the specific screen reader, these might be the keys on the numeric keypad.
The method for doing all this is illustrated in the <a
href="asap.htm"><tt>ASAP.KSC</tt></a> file, for setting K95 up to be used with
the ASAP screen reader.

<h3><hr><a name="install">INSTALLATION AND PATCHING PROBLEMS</a></h3>

[ <a href="#dialer">Next</a> ]
[ <a href="#product">Previous</a> ]
[ <a href="#top">Top</a> ]
<p>

Kermit 95 2.1 is distributed as a
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95upgrade.html">full upgrade</a>
installation to those who have earlier K95 versions, no patching required.

<p>

Kermit 95 1.1.17 and later are distributed on CDROM.  Version 1.1.16 was
distributed only in patch form.  Versions 1.1.15 and earlier were distributed
on diskette.  Since the last diskette release was in 1997, we've removed the
longwinded discussion of problems with diskettes and diskette drives from
the FAQ.

<dl>
<dt><b><i>The Trial Version</i></b>

<dd>A full-featured 21-day trial version of K95 is distributed by our
electronic sales and delivery agent,
<a href="http://www.e-academy.com/kermit">e-academy.com</a>.  The trial
version is the regular release version with a "Vbox" front end applied to
it by e-academy, which consists of a "nag screen" with "Try" and "Buy now"
buttons.  They Buy Now button lets you pay for and obtain a licensed version
of Kermit 95.  This version is discounted since <i>(a)</i> there is no
physical package and <i>(b)</i> the book <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite> is not
included.  <b>Several users have reported problems with the VBOX mechanism</b>:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>Vbox Error: Failed to initialize Vbox!(0002-0053-0081)</tt></dt>

<dd>Windows NT, 2000, or XP only, when logged in as a nonprivileged user.
Vbox requires Administrator privilege due to the rental feature and the need
to update certain files and Registry entries.  Licensed copies of K95 do not
use Vbox and do not have this restriction, but there is no getting around this
issue with the trial version.

<p>

<dt><tt>Vbox Error: Export function: Duplicate TokenEx could not be found in
dynamic library:ADVAPI32.dll. Error code: 127</tt></dt>

<dd>Most likely you are running original Windows 95 and have never installed
any updates.  Apparently the "Vbox" registration component uses Windows
features that were added after original Windows 95.  Usually you can work
around this by installing updates from Microsoft, such as a newer version of
Internet Explorer, which would replace your version of <tt>ADVAPI32.DLL</tt>
with a newer one.  Licensed copies of K95 do not include Vbox and do not have
this problem.

<p>

<dt><i>Other random errors and crashes running the Trial version</i></dt>

<dd>Perhaps your download was incomplete.  It's a large file, and FTP
traffic is one-way only.  Maybe your ISP thought your session was idle and
disconnected you prematurely.  Try checking your mail or browsing the Web
in a separate window periodically to make sure your ISP does not think
your session is idle.

</dl>
<p>

These problems do not affect the large majority of users who download the
trial version.

<p>

<dt><b><i>CDROM installation</i></b>

<dd>In Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP, loading the Kermit 95 CDROM into your
CDROM drive should activate the Windows "Autorun" feature: a few moments after
Windows has compiled the CDROM directory, it pops up the Kermit 95
installation procedure automatically.  If this does not happen to you, access
the CDROM as though it were a regular disk, CD to the <tt>I386</tt>
(Windows/Intel) or other appropriate directory, and start the Setup program.

<p>
<dt><b><i>My PC doesn't have a CDROM drive!</i></b>
<dd>If you purchased the K95 retail package but your PC does not have a
CDROM drive, please contact us for instructions.

<p>

<dt><b><i>I downloaded a K95 upgrade but it won't install!</i></b>

<dd>Did you download the right upgrade?  Read the
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95upgrade.html">download page</a>
carefully to make sure you picked the right file to download.  If the upgrade
file failed to execute at all, be sure you downloaded it binary mode and that
the download completed successfully.  Remember that you can't install the
upgrade unless you have a previous Kermit version installed on the same PC.
If the installer can't find it, it gives you an opportunity to specify its
location.  If you are sure you have the right file, but still can't install
the upgrade (e.g. because the installer can't find your old K95 version or
doesn't accept its registration information),
<a href="mailto://kermit-support@columbia.edu">contact us</a>.

<p>

<dt><b><i>I installed K95 2.x but the icons didn't appear on the desktop</i></b>

<dd>Click your mouse on the desktop and then press the F5 key to refresh
the desktop, or right-click on the desktop and choose Refresh.

<p>
<dt><b><i>I can't reinstall from my original K95 media!</i></b>

<dd>In case you uninstalled K95 for some reason and then want to reinstall it
(e.g. so you can upgrade to K95 2.1), you might run into problems.  For
example, if you bought Kermit 95 prior to version 1.1.17, it was distributed
on diskette; maybe you don't have a diskette drive any more.  Another problem
is that the K95 SETUP program for version 1.1.17 and earlier doesn't work on
disks larger than 2GB.  In such cases,
<a href="mailto://kermit-support@columbia.edu">contact us</a>.

<p>
<dt><b><i>I lost my serial number!</i></b>

<dd>If you sent in your registration card, we have a record of your serial
number.  If not, you'll have to provide convincing proof of purchase before we
can help you.

<h3><hr><a name="dialer">THE K95 DIALER</a></h3>

[ <a href="#starting">Next</a> ]
[ <a href="#install">Previous</a> ]
[ <a href="#top">Top</a> ]
<p>

The Dialer is the graphical front end for Kermit 95.  It is built using a
portable GUI builder that creates versions for  both Windows and OS/2.

<dl>

<dt><b><i>Do I have to use the Dialer?</i></b>

<dd>No.  If you are comfortable typing commands (or creating command files,
macros or scripts) for Kermit 95, you don't need to use the Dialer at all.
The Dialer is recommended to newcomers to Kermit, since it makes it easy to
set up any kind of connection.  Some Kermit veterans prefer to use Kermit 95
directly.

<p>

<dt><b><i>What happened to the nice entry notebooks
that we had in K95 1.1?</i></b>

<dd>All the new pages (SSH, GUI, FTP, etc) made the notebook too big for
Windows 9x/ME.  For a detailed explanation
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/newdialer.html">CLICK HERE</a>.

<p>

<dt><b><i>Why does it take a few seconds for the Dialer to start?</i></b>

<dd>Because:

<p>

<ul>
<li>The portable GUI builder has some overhead (the Dialer runs on OS/2 too).
<li>The Dialer makes backup copies of its database files every time it starts
for your protection.
</ul>

<p>

<dt><b><i><a name="trim">How do I get rid of unwanted Dialer entries?</a></i></b>

<dd>You can not remove an individual predefined entry with the Remove button.
However you can hide <i>all</i> the predefined entries by going into the
Dialer's Options menu, selecting View, and then unchecking "Pre-defined".
If you want to keep <i>some</i> of the predefined entries, just edit the ones
you want to keep; this makes <i>copies</i> of them that are still visible even
if you uncheck Pre-Defined.  NOTE: This question is largely irrelevant in K95
1.1.21 and later, in which all the old and mostly defunct predefined
entries (hundreds of them) were retired.

<p>

<dt><b><i>What are all the <tt>.DAT</tt> files?</i></b>

<dd>Most of <tt>.DAT</tt> files in the Kermit 95 directory are used by the K95
Dialer:

<p>

<dl>

<dt><tt>DIALER.DAT</tt>

<dd>Contains the GUI screen definitions for the Dialer.  It
must not be renamed or deleted.  A particular version of <tt>K95DIAL.EXE</tt>
is keyed to a particular version of the <tt>DIALER.DAT</tt> file.

<p>

<dt><tt>DIALINF.DAT</tt>

<dd>Contains the preloaded Dialer entries.  This file is "read-only",
primarily because it contains templates that are used for constructing other
entries.  (NOTE: In version 1.1.20 and earlier, this file contained hundreds
of BBS and Telnet sites that by now are defunct; these have been removed to
reduce the clutter -- if you need them
<a href="mailto:kermit-support@columbia.edu">send us e-mail</a>.

<p>

<dt><tt>DIALORG.DAT</tt>

<dd>(If any) Contains the preloaded Dialer entries for your organization.
This file can be created by organizations that have K95 bulk or site
licenses.  Like <tt>DIALINF.DAT</tt>, this file is read-only.

<p>

<dt><tt>DIALUSR.DAT</tt>

<dd>Contains <i>(a)</i> entries that you have added;
<i>(b)</i> preloaded entries that you have edited; and <i>(c)</i> the
information from your File and Options pages.

</dl>

<p>

The remaining <tt>.DAT</tt> files are associated with the GUI setup and
registration programs.

<p>

<dt><b><i>Why is my <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> ignored
when I launch a connection from the Dialer?</i></b>

<dd>Your <tt>K95.INI</tt> and <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> files are indeed
executed, but the commands that come from the Dialer are executed after them,
so when there is a conflict the Dialer settings override the
INI-file settings.  Make sure your Dialing Options menu notebook contains the
desired settings, and also the notebook pages for the entries in question.
The primary purpose of the INI files in K-95 is for when you start
<tt>K95.EXE</tt> without the Dialer (or for key or macro definitions that
you always want to be in effect and that don't conflict with settings made
in the Dialer).  As a last resort, you can enter commands
into the Login Script text box in the Dialer entry -- the commands in this box
are executed last.

</dl>

<h3><hr><a name="starting">STARTING AND STOPPING KERMIT 95</a></h3>

[ <a href="#modems">Next</a> ]
[ <a href="#dialer">Previous</a> ]
[ <a href="#top">Top</a> ]
<p>

<dl>

<dt><b><i>Why does Kermit 95 take a few seconds to start?</i></b>

<dd><tt>K95.EXE</tt> can take a while to start because:<ul>

<li>K95 performs a census of all the DLLs it needs to use
-- TAPI, Kerberos, OpenSSL, Zmodem -- and then adapts itself automatically
when any of the DLLs or required entry points within them are missing, rather
than just crashing like most other applications would do.

<li>If a SET PORT TAPI (Microsoft Telephony)
or other TAPI-related command appears in your
<tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt>, TAPI must be initialized, which takes some time,
especially if your modem is turned off or not connected.

<li>The initialization and customization file(s) must be read.

<li>Lack of physical memory might require that Windows 95 allocate swap space
on the hard disk.  

</ul>

<p>

If you use K95 to make different types of connections, not just TAPI, take
the TAPI-related commands out of your <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> file.

<p>

The following command-line options can be used to tell K95 not to load certain
DLLs; this can speed startup:

<p>
<ul>
<li><tt>-# 2</tt>: Do not load Network DLLs (such as Winsock).
<li><tt>-# 4</tt>: Do not load TAPI DLLs (for dialing out).
<li><tt>-# 8</tt>: Do not load Security DLLs (for Kerberos, OpenSSL, encryption).
<li><tt>-# 16</tt>: Do not load XYZMODEM DLLs (for XYZMODEM file transfer).
</ul>
<p>

These numbers are powers of 2, representing single bits, and can be added to
form a "bit mask" of options.  Thus "<tt>-#</tt> <tt>30</tt>" means don't load
any of the above.  On a 90 MHz PC, starting K95 1.1.16 with "<tt>-#</tt>
<tt>30</tt>" took about 1 second; without it about 4 seconds.  You can omit
the network DLLs if you will not be making network connections.  You can omit
TAPI if <i>(a)</i> you will not be making dialout connections, or <i>(b)</i>
you will be using COM1 or COM2 directly rather than the TAPI modem device.
You can omit Kerberos DLLs if you will not be making secure connections with
Kerberos authentication.  You can omit the XYZMODEM DLLs if you will not be
transferring files with XMODEM, YMODEM, or ZMODEM.

<p>

<dt><b><i>Why does it take K95 several seconds to exit?</i></b>

<dd><tt>K95.EXE</tt> might take a while to exit because:
<p>
<ul>
<li>K95 is careful to release all resources that it allocates.
<li>K95 is careful to close connections properly instead of 
just shutting down the subsystems (TAPI, Winsock, ...)
</ul>

<p>

It can take Windows 20-30 seconds to release the TAPI device if your
modem is disconnected or powered off.  When it is connected and turned on,
it still can take 5-10 seconds.  That's Windows, not Kermit, being slow.
If you can use the SET PORT COM<i>x</i> / SET MODEM TYPE <i>xxx</i> interface
instead of the TAPI one (which is possible only for standard COM ports, not
Winmodems, etc), opening and closing of modems will be faster.

<p>

<dt><b><i>How Can I Make K95 Start in a given screen location?</i></b>

<dd>The GUI version (K95G) accepts <tt>--xpos:</tt> and <tt>--xpos:</tt> 
command-line options.  Arguments are in pixels and so depend on your PC's
graphics resolution.  You can put these in a <tt>.bat</tt> file or a
shortcut.
The GUI version also has a SET GUI WINDOW POSITION <i>x y</i> command to
let you specify the screen location in a script.
You can also specify the startup location for any connection in your Dialer
database, on each entry's GUI Settings page.

<p>

<dt><b><i>How can I run a K95 script with arguments?</i></b>

<dd>From a command window or Batch file:

<p>
<pre>
  k95 <i>scriptfilename arg1 arg2 arg3 ...</i> 
</pre>
<p>

Specify the full pathname of K95 (or K95G) if it is not in the PATH.
Specify the full pathname of the script file if it is not in the current
directory.

<p>

In a shortcut to K95 or K95G you can put the script file name and arguments
after the Kermit 95 executable name in the Target box of the Shortcut
properties.

<p>

In a shortcut to a Kermit 95 script file, you can put the arguments to the
script after the script file name in the Target box of the Shortcut properties.

<p>

From the Kermit 95 prompt, or within a Kermit 95 script, you can use the TAKE
command, followed by the script file name, followed by its arguments.

<p>

<dt><b><i>How can I mix K95 arguments and script arguments on the command
line?</i></b>

<dd>Give the script file name as the first command-line argument.  Then
the K95 command-line arguments.  Then an equal sign (=), and finally the
arguments for the script.  Example:
<p>
<pre>
  k95g oofa.ksc --xpos:500 --ypos:500 = "This is script arg 1" scriptarg2
</pre>

<p>

<dt><b><i>How can I run a K95 script by clicking on a URL?</i></b>

<dd>Just make sure the script file name ends in "<tt>,ksc</tt>".  Then use a
URL (<tt>ftp:</tt>, <tt>http:</tt>, <tt>file:</tt>,
whatever) that points to the script.  Examples:

<p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/helper.ksc">http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/helper.ksc</a>
  <a href="ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/scripts/ckermit/helper.ksc">ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/scripts/ckermit/helper.ksc</a>
</pre>
<p>

<dt><b><i>How can I start K95 minimized?</i></b></dt>

<dd>You can do this in a Shortcut -- edit the properties and Choose
Minimized (Console version only, not GUI).  You can also start the Console
version minimized with the Windows command START /MIN.  This is useful for
running Kermit scripts that don't need to interact with the user:
<p>
<pre>
  @start /w /min "C:\Program Files\Kermit 95 2.1\k95.exe" <i>scriptname = args...</i>
</pre>

<p>

K95 2.1.3 and later also have a <tt>--minimized</tt> command-line option
(<tt>--maximized</tt> too).

<dt><b><i>Can I run K95 in a shell window of Windows EMACS?</i></b>

<dd>Yes.  You have to use the Console version (<tt>K95.EXE</tt>,
not <tt>K95G.EXE</tt>).  Start it like this (96 = 32 + 64, the codes for
"use standard input" and "use standard output"):
<p>
<pre>
  k95 -# 96
</pre>
<p>

You can use it to make any kind of connection that you could make from
a regular window: Telnet, SSH, Dialout, FTP, etc, and you can transfer
files over the connection in the normal way.

<p>

The only fly in the ointment is that your keystrokes are read by EMACS, not
K95, and EMACS intercepts Alt keys, F keys, and all Control characters, and
furthermore, doesn't pass your keystrokes to Kermit until after you press the
Enter key, so command-line editing (e.g. Ctrl-U), completion (Esc or
Tab), ?-help, etc, don't work as they do when K95 has "direct access" to
the keyboard.  Escaping back from CONNECT mode is a bit tricky too; you have
to type:

<p>
<pre>
  Ctrl-Q Ctrl-] c CR
</pre>
<p>

That's Ctrl-Q followed by Ctrl-Rightbracket, then the letter C, then press
the Enter key.  In fact, every control character is intercepted by EMACS,
so to pass it through to Kermit you have to quote it with Ctrl-Q, and you
probably also have to hit Enter afterwards.

<p>

And of course, when K95 is using stdio, there is no terminal emulation,
so you can't (for example) run EMACS in your CONNECT session to the host
<tt>:-)</tt>

<p>

But on the plus side, your CONNECT session <i>is</i> an EMACS buffer, so you
can move around in it, edit it, etc, with regular EMACS commands.

<dt><a name="isp"><b><i>Can K95 dial my ISP?</b></i></a>

<dd>Because of Kermit 95's flexibility and programmability, many people ask us
if there is a way that Kermit 95 can be used to make Dial Up Networking
connections, in place of the standard Windows way.  A variation on this
question is: since Kermit can make modem calls, can I use it to make dialed
connections to FTP servers?  Unfortunately, the answer is no; Microsoft does
not provide a way to let an application make a connection to a PPP or SLIP or
FTP server (or Microsoft Windows Terminal Server) and then turn the connection
over to the TCP/IP (or other network protocol) stack.  The only way in Windows
95/98/ME or NT/2000/XP to make a dialup networking connection is with the
built-in Dialup Networking dialer or (in Windows NT) RAS (see notes about RAS
<a href="ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/k95/ras">HERE</a>).  OS/2, on the
other hand, allows this and Kermit 95 for OS/2 has this feature for both PPP
and SLIP.


<p>

<dt><a name="dialin"><b><i>Will K95 let my PC accept incoming calls?</b></i></a>

<dd>Sure.  Of course you can't dial and log in to Windows and get a text-based
shell like you can do with VMS, Unix, and other conventional operating systems
-- Windows was not designed to allow that.  But you can still set up Kermit on
Windows to accept incoming calls and provide a file-transfer and management
service.  There are various ways to do this, of which the most user-friendly,
called <i>host mode</i>, is described <a
href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95host.html">HERE</a>.

<p>

You can also write a simple Kermit script that awaits and handles incoming
calls, something like:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
set port tapi
set speed 57600
set flow rts/cts
while true {
    cd some-directory
    answer 0
    if success {
        server
        hangup
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

Obviously many variations and refinements are possible.

<p>

<dt><a name="comport"><b><i>SET PORT COM3 doesn't work!</b></i></a>

<dd>SET PORT COM1, COM2, COM3, etc, works only with real serial ports.
It won't work with Winmodems and the like, because they are not COM ports.
Make sure the device shows up in the Control Panel's Modems folder and then
use SET PORT TAPI rather than SET PORT COM<i>x</i> to access it.

<p>

<dt><a name="credit"><b><i>How can I make credit-card calls?</i></b></a>

<dd>This applies when you have defined a dialing location in TAPI that includes
a credit card number.

<p>
If you are using the K95 Dialer:
<p>
<ol>
<li>In the Dialer's main menu, choose Options.
<li>Choose Dialing.
<li>Make sure that both TAPI Modem Dialing and TAPI Phone Number Conversions
are checked.
</ol>
<p>
Then when placing a call, make sure:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Your current modem is a TAPI device (not COM1, COM2, etc).
<li>Your current location is the one with the credit card information.
<li>The phone number is portable format, e.g. +1 (212) 7654321.
</ul>
<p>
If the phone number is not in portable format, neither Kermit nor TAPI will
be able to apply any prefixes or suffixes, including the credit card number.
(This process is referred to as "Phone number conversions" in the menus.)
<p>
To create a new TAPI Location that uses a Credit Card:
<p>
<ul>
<li>In the K95 Dialer choose "TAPI->Dialing Properties..."
to display the dialog box.
<li>Click on the "New" button to create a new entry. 
<li>Fill in the appropriate "area code" and numbers to use for 
getting an external line
<li>Check the "Dial using Calling Card" box and then press "Change"
<li>Select the appropriate Calling Card company and service from 
the list.
<li>Fill in the Calling Card number.  
<li>Close all the dialogs to return to the K95 Dialer.
<li>To make the new location the active location, use the
"Location->Current->" list to check the new location.
</ul>
<p>
Now when you dial, these dialing rules -- including the calling card
number -- will be used.
<p>

<dt><a name="parallel"><b><i>Can K95 make connections through the parallel port?</i></b></a>

<dd>In Windows NT, no; in Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, and XP, yes.  In Windows
NT, it is not possible to "set port lpt1" -- i.e. to use a parallel port as a
communications device, because bidirectional parallel ports are not supported
by the NT drivers.  But they are in Windows 95, 98, ME, and 2000, which
include a COM-to-LPT interface.  So in Windows 9x or 2000, you can:

<p><pre>
  SET PORT LPT1
</pre>
<p>

(or other parallel-port device).  Only DOS names are allowed.  Parallel ports
(like Serial ports) are not automatically installed as TAPI devices since they
are not modems.  If you want a parallel port installed as TAPI device you must
manually install it as a "Direct Serial Connection" device.

<p>

<dt><b><i>Can K95 use dialout modems on Telnet terminal servers?</i></b>

<dd>Yes, this has always been possible.  The command sequence is:
<p>
<pre>
  set host <i>hostname port</i>
  set modem type <i>name</i>
  ...
  dial <i>phone-number</i>
</pre>
<p>

However, since the modem is at the other end of a Telnet connection, you
would not normally be able to control its serial-port settings.  But if the
terminal server supports
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2217.txt">RFC2217
Telnet COM Port Control</a> K95 can do everything it could do with a local
PC COM port: set the serial port interface speed and flow control method,
sense modem signals, control the DTR signal, send BREAK, etc.

<dt><a name="nasi"><b><i>Does K95 work with Novell NASI modem sharing?</i></b></a>

<a href="http://support.novell.com/"><tt>http://support.novell.com/</tt></a>
on 24 July 1998, 
"In order for NT to access the modem pool, WIN2NCS version 2.11 must be

Windows NT is now supported.  However, there is still an issue with
the interaction of Win2NCS with Microsoft's TAPI which may cause
problems with Host mode on some Remote Control applications. This is
currently under investigation."
<i>(The download link provided for WIN2NCS no longer works.)</i>

<dt><a name="isdn"><b><i>Can K95 be used with ISDN?</i></b></a>

<dd>ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network)
is a digital alternative of the analog telephone system.
<a href="http://www.seg.co.uk/seg/isdnover.htm">CLICK HERE</a> for an
ISDN tutorial.  Kermit 95 can be used with ISDN in the following ways:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Kermit 95 works with any ISDN connection that provides TCP/IP services.
In this case, K95 is simply a Telnet or Rlogin client, as it would be on any
other kind of TCP/IP connection.
<p>
<li>Kermit 95 works with any ISDN device that provides a Windows Telephony
Service Provider Interface (TSPI).  In this case, Kermit can place ISDN calls
using TAPI.  Example: the AVM Fritz!Card with CapiPort driver, or the Teles
X.75 Modem TAPI device for Windows 95.
<p>
<li>Kermit 95 works with any ISDN device that provides a 32-bit COM-port
emulator, such as the version of Teles CAPI for Windows NT.
</ul>
<p>
Kermit 95 does not include a direct CAPI interface.

<dl>

<dt><b><i>Can Kermit 95 dial my PPP (or SLIP or ADSL) connection?</i></b>

<dd>In OS/2: yes.  In Windows, no.  Windows provides no mechanism for a user
application to turn a modem connection over to the Windows TCP/IP stack.  This
question is answered in more detail in the <a href="#modems">previous
section</a>.

<p>

<dt><a name="incoming"><b><i>Will K95 let my PC accept incoming network connections?</b></i></a>

<dd>Yes.  The preferred method for this in Windows NT, 2000, and XP is
to install K95 as an <i>Internet Kermit Service</i>, explained
<a href="wiksd.htm">HERE</a>.  You can also use <i>host mode</i>, which
can be used in Windows 95/98/ME as well as NT/2000/XP, and is explained
<a href="k95host.htm">HERE</a>.  You can also execute a command such as:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
set host /server * 3000
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

to tell K95 to wait for an incoming TCP/IP connection on port 3000 and then
automatically enter server mode when the connection comes in.

<p>

<dt><b><i>Can Kermit 95 be the Telnet helper for my Web Browser?</i></b>

<dd>Yes. This gives you many advantages over the regular Telnet program.
Just to name a few: you can transfer files while in your Telnet
session; you have more and better terminal emulations to choose from;
and you have colors, scrollback, key mapping, and local printing.
Simply point your Browser at the <tt>TELNET.EXE</tt> program in the Kermit 95
directory instead of at regular system Telnet.

<p>

<dt><b><i>Why does Dialup networking pop up whenever I make a Telnet
connection?</i></b>

<dd>This is not a Kermit problem -- the same thing would happen with any
Internet application, such as Microsoft Telnet or FTP.  To fix: open your
Windows 95 Dial Up Networking folder (should be in your "My Computer"
folder), go to <i>Connections .. Settings .. General</i> and choose "Don't
prompt to use Dial-Up Networking".


<p>

<dt><b><i>Why does my Dialup Networking Connection freeze occasionally?</i></b>

<dd>Most likely because you have "Allow OS to power down the NIC to save
power" checked in the Control Panel.

<p>
<dt><a name="login"><b><i>How can I force the Telnet server to issue a login prompt?</i></b></a>

<dd>When K-95 is used to Telnet to a host that whose Telnet server supports the
TELNET NEW-ENVIRONMENT option or certain other options, K-95 sends your
Windows user ID automatically, unless you have done something to prevent this
from happening.  In this case, the host does not prompt you for a user ID, but
just a password.
<p>
If your Windows user ID is the same as your ID on the host you are Telneting
to, you only need to supply your password on the host, since it already has
your user ID.
<p>
However, if they are not the same, or if you want to ensure predictable
behavior, e.g. in a script program, you can instruct K-95 not to send your
user ID with the command:
<p><pre>
  set login userid
</pre>
<p>
(without a user ID).  Then the host will give its normal <tt>login:</tt> or 
<tt>Username:</tt> prompt.  Put this command in your <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt>
file or your script file, depending on where/when you want it to apply.

<p>

<dt><b><i>How do I make secure Internet connections?</i></b>

<dd>Kermit 95 can make secure TCP/IP connections using SSH v1 or v2
(K95 1.1.21 and later), SSL, TLS, Kerberos 4, Kerberos 5, and
Secure Remote Password (SRP) (<a href="security.htm#servers">CLICK HERE</a>
for information about secure Telnet servers).  The secure connection methods
are documented in the Kermit 95 Manual and in several supplementary documents.
Secure connections are usually configured by network administrators rather
than end users; consult your network administrator to see what forms of
security are available at your site and to find out how to configure Kermit 95
to use them if they are among the methods supported by K95.  If you <i>are</i>

cost, and therefore the price, of K95 up considerably.  To add SOCKS5 to K95
would require a new implementation be written from scratch, something we have
not had time to do.  If you're a programmer and you want SOCKS5 added to K95,

<pre>
  set key \4385 \Kignore  ; Gray Page Up
  set key \4386 \Kignore  ; Gray Page Down

  set key \5409 \Kignore  ; Ctrl Gray Page Up
  set key \5410 \Kignore  ; Ctrl Gray Page Down
</pre>
<p>
You can do this in the GUI version too, but that doesn't remove the
scrollbar.  However, it's harder to scroll back by accident with the mouse
than it is to hit the wrong key by mistake.

<p>

In both the Console and GUI version, you can <i>limit</i> the scrollback
capacity with:

<p>
<pre>
  set terminal scrollback <i>number-of-lines</i>  ; <i>(Terminal screen)</i>
  set command scrollback <i>number-of-lines</i>   ; <i>(Command screen)</i>
</pre>
<p>

However, the minimum number of lines is 256.

<p>

In Kermit 95 2.1.3 you can disable the GUI scroll bars, as well as the keyboard
verbs that accomplish scrolling -- no matter what keys they are assigned to --
with the new NOSCROLL command or the new <tt>--noscroll</tt> command-line
option.

<dt><b><i>How Do I Clear the Screen without Saving it in Scrollback?</i></b>

<dd>Material is saved in scrollback whenever <i>(a)</i> a line scrolls off the
top of the screen or <i>(b)</i> the whole screen is cleared.  To clear the
screen without having it saved in scrollback, have the host send an escape
sequence like this:

<p>
<pre>
  &lt;ESC&gt;[2;1H&lt;ESC&gt;[J&lt;ESC&gt;[1;1H&lt;ESC&gt;[K

<p>

<ol>
<li>Puts cursor on the second screen line, left margin.
<li>Clears from cursor to end of screen.
<li>Puts cursor in home position.
<li>Clears from cursor to end of line.

<p>

These forms of clearing do not enter anything into the scrollback buffer.

<dt><b><i>Help!  My Keyboard Has Gone Crazy!</i></b>
<dd>The most likely explanation is that you accidently typed one of the
following key combinations:

<p>
<ul>

<li>Left-Alt-Left-Shift: This is a Windows function that Kermit never sees.
If you have more than one keyboard language defined, this toggles your
keyboard among them.  You can undo this by typing Left-Alt-Left-Shift again,
as many times as needed to return to the desired keyboard language (the number
depends on how many keyboard languages you have defined).  Or you can open the
keyboard icon on the Windows Taskbar and explicitly select the desired
language.  Or if you really don't need to have multiple keyboard languages
defined: use <i>Control Panel &rarr; Regional and Language Options &rarr; 
Languages &rarr; Text services and input languages</i> to remove keyboard
languages; if you have only one defined, there is no more mysterious
keyboard-language switching.

<p>

<li>Right-Ctrl-Right-Shift: Depending on what Windows version you have,
this one might might also toggle among keyboard languages.

<p>

<li>Ctrl-CapsLock: The toggles PCTERM mode Kermit's emulator, in which
each key sends separate up/down codes.  If you get into this mode by accident,
Kermit's Terminal Screen status line says:

<p>
<pre>
 PCTERM  Ctrl-CAPSLOCK to deactive.
</pre>
<p>

(if your current emulation includes a status line).  In any case, you can
restore the keyboard to normal with another Ctrl-CapsLock or, in K95G, in
the Actions menu.

</ul>
<p>

<dt><b><i>Why did my printer suddenly start printing?</i></b>

<dd>The most likely explanation is that you accidently typed one of the
following key combinations: Alt-P (print screen), Alt-O (start
Copy-to-Printer), Alt-E (force printer page eject / formfeed), or the 
Print Screen key.  Also, the host might have sent a "transparent print" escape
sequence, or noise or binary data arrived at the terminal emulator that is the

Copy-to-Printer or transparent printing.

<dt><b><i>How Do I Access IBM Mainframes?</i></b>

<dd>Presently, Kermit 95 does not include IBM 3270 terminal emulation, nor a
tn3270 client.  The only way it can have IBM mainframe fullscreen sessions is
through an intermediate 3270 protocol converter:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Dialup to a Series/1, 7171, 4994, or the like.
<li>Dialup or Telnet to a Cisco terminal server; tn3270 from there.
<li>Dialup or Telnet to any Unix host that has a tn3270 program; tn3270 from
there to the mainframe.
</ul>
<p>

Most IBM mainframe operating systems support "linemode" sessions, which are
similar to hardcopy sessions -- no screen formatting.  Unless your IBM
mainframe has linemode disabled, you should be able to establish a regular
Telnet session to it.  You can transfer files between K95 and Kermit-370 over

<dt><a name="echo"><b><i>Why does scrolling or echoing seem slow?</i></b></a>

<dd>They don't to most people.  But on certain PCs, under certain
circumstances, there might be a perceptible delay in scrolling or in echoing
of the characters you type.  This delay can have several components:

<p>
<ol>

<li>Delays in the connection itself;
<li>How heavily loaded Windows is;
<li>Windows scheduling of K95's several threads and its semaphore management;
<li>An extra (double) layer of overhead imposed by <tt>CONAGENT.EXE</tt>
(Windows 95/98/ME only).
<li>Peculiarities of your video andapter and driver;
<li>K95's own screen update algorithm.

</ol>
<p>

Normally K95 refreshes the entire screen every 100 milliseconds, i.e. 10 times
per second.  This has proven to provide the best overall throughput, which is
always a tradeoff between <i>(a)</i> responsiveness to keystrokes, and
<i>(b)</i> speed of displaying large amounts of scrolling text.  You can
change the balance and the frequency with the command:

<p>

<dl><dt><tt>SET TERMINAL SCREEN-UPDATE</tt> <i>{</i> <tt>FAST, SMOOTH</tt> <i>} [ milliseconds ]</i>

<dd>Chooses the mechanism used for screen updating and the update frequency.
Defaults are FAST scrolling with updates every 100 milliseconds.

</dl>
<p>

A smaller interval might produce snappier echoing, but probably at the expense
of scrolling speed.  SMOOTH forces screen refresh with every incoming
character, and so turns the balance to totally favor fast echoing.

<p>

In version 1.1.16, K95's echoing strategy has been redesigned to give
snappier echoing on modem connections, virtually eliminating any delay that
can not be attributable to external causes.  Echoing of a
character from the local modem's command processor now takes less than 0.001
second, compared to about 0.110 second in 1.1.15.

<p>

Also, beginning in 1.1.16, screen updates are optimized.  This results in
noticeable speed improvements on most PCs, but paradoxically, slows down some
others.  To disable optimization, use:

<dt><a name="winprinter"><b><i>Can Kermit 95 use Winprinters?</i></b></a>

<dd>As noted in the documentation, Kermit 95 can print only on printers
capable of printing either raw text and/or PostScript.  Kermit does not 
support Graphical Device Contexts for Printer output, used by Winprinters.
From Chapter 7 of the Kermit 95 online manual:

<p>
<blockquote>

So-called "WinPrinters" are presently not supported by Kermit 95.  These
printers are marketed specifically for use with Microsoft Windows operating
systems, and work only with Microsoft Windows.  It might seem strange that
Kermit 95 does not support them, since Kermit 95 is a native Windows 32-bit
application, but "WinPrinters" require the print job to be formatted by the
Win32 application.  Transparent printing material, however, contains escape
sequences or other non-textual data that can not be formatted as text.

<p>

Ironically, WinPrinters come with a 16-bit driver for use by DOS
applications, but since K95 is a 32-bit application, it can't see this driver.
Presently, the only way to print on a WinPrinter from Kermit 95 is to:
<p>
<pre>
  set printer <i>xxx</i>
</pre>
<p>
where <i>xxx</i> is a filename, and then to:
<p>
<pre>
  run copy /b <i>xxx</i> prn
</pre>
<p>
(i.e. run the DOS command to copy the print file in binary mode to the DOS
printer).  A series of macros can be defined to accomplish this, and can be
assigned to hot keys to make printing to Windows printers relatively painless.

<dl>
<dt><a name="xfer"><b><i>Problems uploading files?</i></b></a>

<dd>Kermit 95 as well as C-Kermit 7.0 and later default to high-performance
file-transfer settings: long packets, sliding windows, "cautious"
control-character prefixing, and -- on connections that allow it -- streaming.
But, as we point out in the documentation, these settings are less likely to
work <i>everywhere</i> than the normal conservative settings that are the
default in most other Kermit programs, and which are the cause of the widely
held misimpression that "Kermit is slow".

<p>

Sometimes file transfers -- especially uploads of binary files --
fail using these settings.  Such failures can almost always be fixed by
restoring full control-character prefixing:

<p>
<pre>
  SET PREFIXING ALL
</pre>
<p>

Or in the Dialer, edit the connection's File Transfer page.  Change
Performance to Custom, and change Control Char Prefixing to Never.

<p>

If that doesn't help, then give this command:

<p><pre>
  CAUTIOUS
</pre><p>

If you still have problems, give this command:

<p><pre>
  ROBUST
</pre><p>

(You can choose these on the Dialer's File Transfer page too).

<p>

If none of that helps, then consult Chapter 10 of <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>,
2nd Edition: "Solving File Transfer Problems".  And if <i>that</i> doesn't
help, maybe K95's file-transfer partner has a defective Kermit implementation.
Kermit 95 offers workarounds for most of the implementation bugs we know
about in other products; click

<dt><b><i>Using K95 with Host-Based E-Mail Programs</i></b>

<dd>As described <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/safe.html">HERE</a>,
in these days of e-mail viruses, it is not a bad idea to avoid PC-based email
programs and read all your email with a host-based plain-text e-mail client
like Pine, Rmail, or MM.  When you do this, you see MIME enclosures in their
raw encoded format; for example base-64 encoding: many, many lines of:

<p>
<pre>
  /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wBDAAIBAQEBAQIBAQECAgICAgQDAgICAgUEBAMEBgUGBgYF
  BgYGBwkIBgcJBwYGCAsICQoKCgoKBggLDAsKDAkKCgr/2wBDAQICAgICAgUDAwUKBwYHCgoKCgoK
  CgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgr/wAARCAQNBgADASIA
  AhEBAxEB/8QAHwAAAQUBAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQFBgcICQoL/8QAtRAAAgEDAwIEAwUFBAQA
</pre>
<p>

So how to view that snapshot that Aunt Hilda sent you?  The labor-intensive
method is to save the message in a separate file, edit out the base-64 encoded
picture, save that to still another file, decode it into its original JPG,
GIF, or BMP format into yet another file using the appropriate decoder, and
then either put it on your own host-based website and (after setting the
permissions appropriately) view it from your PC browser, or download it to
your PC and tell K95 to "<tt>run</tt> <tt>start</tt> <tt>hilda.jpg</tt>" or
whatever.

<p>

Here's an easier method, but one that's not quite as safe:

<p>
<ol>

<li>Make sure the message doesn't contain any enclosures besides <tt>.jpg</tt>,
<tt>.gif</tt> or <tt>.bmp.</tt>  Also make sure it's from someone you know
<i>and</i> that it contains text that they wrote that makes sense to you, like
"Here's a cute picture of little Otto at the beach".  Just because it SAYS
it's from somebody you know doesn't mean it really is!  (Any mail that you
receive these days, even from a friend or family member, is just as likely
to have been generated automatically by a virus program.)

<p>

<li>Tell your mail program to copy the message to a file, <tt>xxx.eml</tt>.
Substitute whatever you want for <tt>xxx</tt>, but you must use the
"<tt>.eml</tt>" extension because that's the one Windows associates with
its e-mail client.

<p>

<li>Exit from your e-mail program and download the <tt>.eml</tt> file to
windows:
<p>
<pre>
  kermit -s xxx.eml                <i>(Substitute actual file name)</i>
</pre>

<p>

<li>Escape back to the Kermit prompt with Alt-x and type:
<p>
<pre>
  run start xxx.eml                <i>(Substitute actual file name)</i>
</pre>
</ol>

<p>

This starts your Windows e-mail client (e.g. Outlook Express) with the
mail message in it so you can see the picture(s).  But again: be careful!
If the message contained any enclosures other than pictures (such as
Visual Basic scripts, Microsoft Word documents, HTML, ActiveX, etc),
they could give your PC a virus, as explained
in the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/safe.html">Safe Computing</a>
document.  In more recent versions of Windows, particularly those with
security patches, the Microsoft mail client might refuse to show you any
enclosures that are not pictures.

<p>
<dt><b><i>Accessing a Port-Blocked Mail Server with SSH Port Forwarding</i></b>

<dd>Suppose you're on a business trip with your Windows laptop that you
normally use to read your email using a Windows-based mail client.  You find
that you can't get at the mail server because you're outside the corporate
firewall.  But you <i>can</i> still make SSH connections through the firewall.
Here's how you can use Kermit 95 to "tunnel" through your SSH connection to
mail server.  Before making your SSH connection, give a command such as:

<p>
<pre>
  ssh add local-port 25 email.xyzcorp.com 25
</pre>
<p>

in which email.xyzcorp.com should be replaced by the hostname of your own mail
server, and 25 is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP, i.e. mail server)
Internet port.  This sets up TCP port 25 on your PC to forward to port 25
on the e-mail host through the SSH tunnel.

<p>

Now SSH to your login host.  In your mail program, set the SMTP server to
"localhost".  Then as long as you keep the SSH connection open, you can use
your mail program in the usual way.

<p>

The same trick can be used for any other TCP service that might be blocked
from normal access.

<dt><b><i>How do I embed Kermit in my application?</i></b>

<dd>Many software makers ask us for Kermit software in special forms that can
be embedded in their applications, to provide file transfer or other
communications functions to their customers.  But each software maker wants
something different:

<p>
<ul>

<li>Connection establishment but no data transfer
<li>Data transfer using pre-existing connection
<li>Connection establishment <i>and</i> data transfer
<li>File transfer only without "bells and whistles"
<li>Scripting but not terminal emulation
<li>Terminal emulation but not file transfer
<li>Serial communication but not networking
<li>Networking but not serial communications
<li>Binary file transfer but not text
<li>Greek character-set conversion but not Cyrillic
<li>Access to shell escapes allowed
<li>Access to shell escapes forbidden
<li>A pretty display
<li>No display at all

</ul>
<p>

and on and on.  And they desire this functionality to be packaged as a link
library for this or that platform, a DLL, an OCX, a VBX, an Active X control,
a Delphi component, a Netscape Plugin, a Java object, a Visual FoxPro object,
etc etc etc.  The combinations of functionality and interface are many, and
there is no way we can satisfy them without warehouses full of programmers,
which nobody can afford to pay for.

<p>

Consequently we recommend that software makers who wish to embed Kermit
functionality in their products (communications, scripting, file transfer,
terminal emulation, character-set translation, etc) license and use the
programs we already have available.  See the next item for an example.

<p>

The "API" (Application Program Interface) <i>is</i> the command language.  It
is more fully expressive, precise, comprehensive, and <i>portable</i> than any
other API that could be designed (look at all the commands in C-Kermit or
MS-DOS Kermit or Kermit 95; each one is there for a reason).  As new releases
of the Kermit program come out, your product can be easily updated and will
benefit from all the new features, fixes, and speedups automatically.

<p>

The recommended method of embedding Kermit in another application is via
command-line invocation.  The Kermit command line can contain a selection of
simple commands, and it can also refer to more complex command files or scripts
composed by your application.  Kermit can be configured to create any kind of
log you need, and it can return the status of its operations in various ways
that can be used by your application.

<p>

When you license Kermit software for embedding in your application, we are
happy to work with you to ensure it meets your needs.  And if Kermit protocol
transfers are important to you, then it should also be important to you to
come to the source -- we developed the protocol, we continue to improve it,
we believe in it, and we stand behind it.

<p>

Following this advice allows each party to concentrate on what they are good
at, rather than unnecessarily duplicating efforts and "reinventing the wheel".
You concentrate on your application; we'll do the communications.  We support
our software, you support yours, everybody is happy.

<p>

As of October 2002, there is another possibliity available to programmers:
<a href="ek.html">Embedded Kermit</a>.  This is a Kermit module suitable for
embedding.  It's not a application, it's a "subroutine;" you have to integrate
it into your application and provide all the communications and file i/o.


<dt><a name="vbx"><b><i>How do I invoke Kermit 95 from Visual Basic?</i></b></a>

<dd>Easy.  First refer to <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>, "Starting and Stopping
C-Kermit".  Note that you can invoke K95 with a command-line argument
specifying the name of a file containing commands to execute; this filename
must be the first argument after the program name.
Suppose, for example, <tt>K95.EXE</tt> is in the PATH, and the command file is
called <tt>UPDATE.KSC</tt>.  Then the command line would be, simply:

<p>
<pre>
  k95 update.ksc
</pre>
<p>

The command file can be prefabricated, or it can be created dynamically by
your application.  If it is not in the current directory, of course you must
specify the full path:

<p>
<pre>
  k95 d:\scripts\update.ksc
</pre>
<p>

If you want K95 to exit automatically when the script is complete, put EXIT
commands in the script wherever you want to return control to your VB program.

<p>

To invoke K95 from VB, use:

<p>
<pre>
  Shell (<i>commandline</i>, <i>windowstyle</i>)
</pre>
<p>

where <i>commandline</i> is the command with which to invoke Kermit 95,
such as "k95 update.ksc", and <i>windowstyle</i> is one of the following:

<p>
<pre>
  0 - <i>Hidden</i>
  1 - <i>Window has focus and is restored</i>
  2 - <i>Window is an icon with focus</i>
  3 - <i>Window is maximized with focus</i>
  4 - <i>Window is restored, current window keeps focus</i>
  6 - <i>Window is an icon, current window keeps focus</i>
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>Shell()</tt> function returns Kermit 95's task ID.

<p>
<dt><a name="vbx"><b><i>How do I invoke Kermit 95 from Java?</i></b></a>

<dd>You have to use the GUI version of Kermit 95 2.0 or later for this
(<tt>K95G.EXE</tt>, not <tt>K95.EXE</tt>).  If you need to use the Console
version (<tt>K95.EXE</tt>) for some reason, you have to work around problems
with how <tt>javaw.exe</tt> starts Console applications, you must begin with a
Console window, run <tt>java.exe</tt> in it, and then start <tt>K95.EXE</tt>
from there.
