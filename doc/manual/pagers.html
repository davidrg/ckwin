can dial <b>beepers</b> and can send both <b>numeric pages</b> and
<b>alphanumeric pages</b>.
Pagers can be dialed not only through a modem that is connected
to a serial port on the computer where Kermit is running, but also through
modems mounted on TCP/IP "reverse terminal servers".

<p>
<hr>
<b>Beepers</b> and <b>numeric pagers</b> are dialed using a special form of
the DIAL command that does not require the call to be answered with a carrier
signal.  Example:
<pre>
  set modem hangup-method modem-command ; (if necessary)
  set modem type usrobotics  ; Substitute actual modem type
  set line /dev/ttyS0        ; Substitute actual device name
  set speed 2400             ; Try other speeds if you want
  pdial 7654321@             ; Substitute actual phone number
  clear dial-status
  hangup
</pre>
(this dials a beeper), or to dial a numeric pager and leave a message,
as above but:
<pre>
  pdial 7654321@123456#
</pre>
<p>
The SET MODEM HANGUP-METHOD tells Kermit how to make your modem hang up
the phone call.  In C-Kermit 7.0 and earlier, the default hangup method
is MODEM-COMMAND, meaning "pause 1 sec, send +++, pause one sec, send
ATH0 and carriage return".  Starting with C-Kermit 8.0, the default
method is RS232-SIGNAL, meaning the computer should turn off the port's DTR
(Data Terminal Ready) signal for half a second.  If one of these doesn't
work, try the other.

<p>

If your modem does not support the "wait for quiet answer" feature (@),
you can use commas to force a pause:
<pre>
  pdial 7654321,,,,123456#
</pre>
<p>
However, in this case, the modem will say OK even if the line is busy, and
therefore Kermit has no way of knowing if the call succeeded or failed (and
therefore automatic redialing in case of failure will not work).

<p>

In case you're not familiar with Kermit's automation features, here's how
to turn the above procedure into a script that you can run with a single
command from the shell prompt.  CD to some directory that's in your PATH
and that you have write access to and create a file called <tt>ring</tt>
(or any other name you wish) that looks something like this:

<p>
<pre>
  #!/usr/local/bin/kermit +
  if ( < 2 \v(argc) ) exit 1 Usage: \%0: phone-number [ message ]
  set modem hangup-method modem-command
  set modem type usrobotics
  set line /dev/ttyS0
  set speed 2400
  pdial \%1@\%2
  if fail exit 1
  exit 0
</pre>
<p>

<tt>\%1</tt> and <tt>\%2</tt> are the command-line parameters.
The top line must specify the path of the 
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html">Kermit executable</a>.
<p>
Now give the file execute permission:
<p>
<pre>
  chmod +x ring
</pre>
<p>
Now you can use it to dial any number, just as if it were a regular Unix
command:
<p>
<pre>
  ring 7654321            <i>(Just dials the number)</i>
  ring 7654321 1234567    <i>(Dials the number and then leaves a message)</i>
</pre>
<p>

<i>Test numeric paging applications thoroughly.</i>  They work only as well as
your modem, and most modems were not designed with paging in mind.

<p>
<hr>
<b>Alphanumeric pages</b> can be sent in various ways:
<p>
<ol>
<li>By making a voice call to your paging service and dictating the message.
<li>By sending email to your paging service.
<li>By dialing your paging service with a modem and carrying on an interactive
dialog.
<li>By dialing your paging service and executing a standardized error checking
and correcting protocol to send the page.
</ol>

Option (1) is not well suited to automation; option (2) is little help if your
network is down (which might be why you wanted to send the page in the first
place); the problem with option (3) is that the format and sequencing of the
dialog is not standardized, so different scripts are needed at different times
with different services.

<p>

Option (4) is implemented by a C-Kermit script that implements the Telocator
Alphanumeric Protocol (TAP) of the <a href="http://www.pcia.com"> Personal
Communications Industry Association</a>, also known as IXO, a standardized
protocol that performs
error detection and correction to ensure the page is sent correctly.
As with other kinds of modem calls, automatic redialing is supported in the
case of busy signals, etc, and the dialing directory may be used -- allowing
the same pager number to be dialed from different areas or countries without
having to enter different phone numbers for each calling location.

<p>

For Alpha pages, Kermit's script language allows the page to be retried (and
redialed if necessary) until it is acknowledged, to ensure the page has been
sent, and sent correctly.  Pages may be sent "by hand" or from an automated
or scheduled procedure such as a cron job in UNIX, or by any sort of shell
or other script, for example one that monitors the system, applications, or
network, and needs to notify the appropriate personnel in case a fault is
detected.

<p>

By the way, it is important to note that most paging services act as if they
were designed to receive calls only from 1200-bps modems, such as the Hayes
1200.  Many of them seem not to work (communicate) at all when called from a
modern error-correcting, data-compressing modem; the initial negotations
confuse them hopelessly.  Therefore, when using Kermit to send pages, you
must tell Kermit what kind of modem you actually have so it knows how to give
it the "error-correction off" and "compression off" commands prior to placing
the call.  In other words, if you have (say) a Megahertz Xjack 56K modem,
don't tell Kermit you have a Hayes 1200 -- tell it what you really have.

<p>

And be sure to follow the paging service's instructions as to speed and
parity.

<p>

Other Kermit programs, such as MS-DOS Kermit for DOS and Windows 3.x, can
be scripted to send beeps or numeric pages;
see the <a href="faq.html">Kermit FAQ</a>,
<a href="faq.html#faq-c-npg">item 16</a>, for details.
