This graphic illustrates how Kermit 95, given a sufficiently populated
monospaced font (such as <a href="http://www.monotype.com">Agfa Monotype</a>
Andale Mono 64 WT J, shown here), can display text in many languages and
writing systems in a terminal session.  The quality of the display and the
appearance of each character, of course, depend on the font and your screen
resolution.  Kermit's host character set in this case is UTF-8 (a form of
<a href="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</a>), which is the only character set
capable of encompassing such a comprehensive repertoire.  Notes:

<p>
<ul>

<li>Anglo-Saxon is written in both Latin letters and Runes.

<p>

<li>The Arabic and Hebrew phrases are backwards -- in terminal-based
communication, management of bidirectionality is the responsibility of the
host application (the application used in the example is simply the Unix 'cat'
command, which is not BIDI-aware).  See below for a Hebrew-aware
host-based application.

<p>

<li>The Hindi example includes some combining characters, which Kermit 95
does not presently handle.  These are shown in separate cells.  We plan to
support combining sequences in a future release.

<p>

<li>The Chinese, Japanese, and Korean examples are cramped because this is a
monospace font.  In future K95 releases, we hope to devise a method for
displaying CJK characters in doublewidth.

<p>

<li>The Armenian letters are rather diminutive and have their descenders cut
off; that's a characteristic of this font.  The Georgian descenders are also
slightly clipped.  See the final example on this page for better renderings of
Armenian and Georgian.

</ul>
<p>

For comparison, here is a screen shot with a different font, Courier New,
which comes standard on most Microsoft operating systems, and can be
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011217203324/http://www.microsoft.com/truetype/fontpack/1">downloaded from
Microsoft</a> (via archive.org) in case you don't have it:

As you can see, the repertoire is smaller.  

<a name="aleph">Now, for Right-to-Left languages:</a>

<p>

<img alt="Screen shot" src="hebrew1.gif">

<p>

This is a shot of the English/Hebrew/Yiddish bibliographic system called ALEPH
from Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which runs on VMS with DEC VT terminal
emulation, using ISO 2022 character-set designation and invocation sequences
to switch between ASCII and the ISO 8859-8 Latin/Hebrew alphabet (shown as
"hebrew-iso" in the character-set selection combo box).  Here Kermit 95
converts between the host encoding and the native Unicode encoding on Windows.
The main page is in English with a Hebrew subheading.  Entering "?/HEB"
switches to Hebrew mode:

<p>

<p>

in which we have a Hebrew menu and search screens, and where typing Hebrew
letters (which can be done with the regular Windows Hebrew keyboard driver or
with Kermit's built-in Hebrew keyboard mode) echoes from right to left (and
Roman from left to right), all under control of the host application, which
works by positioning each character on the screen with escape sequences.


<p>

<a name="keyboard">As to <i>typing</i></a>
Unicode characters at the keyboard . . . &nbsp; &nbsp;
Keyboard input methods are evolving and changing all the time.  Clearly, no
single keyboard can be expected to have all the characters of all the world's
writing systems; thus many fancy schemes are devised to allow (for example)
input of Chinese characters on a Roman keyboard.  There is, however, a very
straightfoward (if not especially convenient) method for entering any
character, illustrated here:

<p>

<p>

Kermit 95 has always had a Compose key (Alt-C by default), usable for
composing accented Roman characters.  Now it also has a Unicode key (assigned
by default to Alt-N, also accessible from the Actions menu).  When you press
the Unicode key, you get a mini-dialog in the status line, in which you may
type exactly 4 hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, case of letters doesn't matter),
which denote a Unicode character in the Base Multilingual Plane.  Kermit
converts this to whatever character set is in use on the host and sends the
result.  Of course, you need a Unicode code chart to know which codes
correspond to what characters.  For this you can use
<a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/">The Unicode
Standard</a> itself (a book, now online) or the online material at the
<a href="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode Consortium</a>.
The screenshot was produced by pressing Alt-N to enter Unicode Compose mode
and then Alt-H to get context-sensitive help.

<a name="emt">Finally</a>, here's a shot of the original sample text using the
new <a href="http://www.evertype.com">Everson Mono Terminal</a> font that was
previously packaged with K95 2.x:

<p>

<p>

Note that the Hindi, Chinese, and Korean are missing; the Japanese shows only
Kana (no Kanji), but the rest is there, including the Runes, Armenian, and
Georgian missing from Courier New.  The spacing is a bit looser than Courier
or Andale Mono (hence no descenders are clipped) and the effect lighter.
