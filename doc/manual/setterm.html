<title>Kermit 95 - The SET TERMINAL Command</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<h2>The SET TERMINAL Command</h2>

Kermit 95's <tt>SET</tt> <tt>TERMINAL</tt> and related commands
can be issued at the <tt>K-95&#62;</tt> prompt in the Command window,
or from a command or initialization file, to change most aspects of the
terminal emulator.

<dl>
<dt><tt>SET BELL <i>{</i> AUDIBLE <i>{</i> BEEP, SYSTEM-SOUNDS <i>}</i>, VISIBLE, FLASH-WINDOW [ { ON, OFF } ], NONE <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>This command tells how bell (beep) characters / noises should be sounded
or displayed.  <tt>VISIBLE</tt> means to flash the screen rather than making a
noise.  <tt>AUDIBLE</tt> means to make a noise, which can be either the
standard "beep", or else "System sounds" that give you three different noises
for "information", "warning", and "error".
<p>The FLASH-WINDOW option can be specified independently of and in addition
    to other options. It causes the window title and taskbar button to flash
    when a Bell is received.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET COMMAND COLOR <i>foreground-color</i> <i>background-color</i></tt>
<dd>Like <tt>SET TERMINAL COLOR</tt>, except for the Command screen.  This
command lets you choose the fore- and background colors of the Command screen.
See <a href="#termcolor"><tt>SET TERMINAL COLOR</tt></a> , or type "set
command color ?", for a list of colors to choose from.  Example: "set command
color black white" for black letters on a white background.
<p>
<dt><tt><a name="trmtyp">SET TERMINAL TYPE <i>{</i> ANSI, TTY, VT52, VT100, VT102, VT220, VT320, ... <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>  Choose the type of terminal that Kermit should emulate in the Terminal
window.  <a href="termtype.html">CLICK HERE</a> for a complete list.  If you
choose an <a href="gloss.html#g_ansi">ANSI</a> type, the appropropriate
coloration, character set, and screen size are chosen for you automatically.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL ALTERNATE-BUFFER <i>{</i> ENABLED, DISABLED <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Enables or disables the escape sequence for switching to the alternate
terminal screen buffer. This setting can also be changed via an escape
sequence so setting it to disabled may not prevent its use entirely.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL ANSWERBACK <i>{</i> OFF, ON, <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>  Disables/enables the ENQ/Answerback sequence, which is:
<p>
<pre>
  K-95 800201 VT320&#60;CR&#62;
</pre>
<p>
where VT320 is the current terminal emulation, and &#60;CR&#62; is
a carriage return.  800201 is the Kermit software version number (which
changes from one release to the next).
When <tt>SET TERM ANSWERBACK</tt> is <tt>ON</tt>, this message is sent
automatically by Kermit 95 when a Ctrl-E is received.  <tt>TERM
ANSWERBACK</tt> is <tt>OFF</tt> by default.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL ANSWERBACK MESSAGE <i>text</i></tt>
<dd>Appends the <i>text</i> to the standard answerback message, separated
by an underscore.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL ANSWERBACK UNSAFE-MESSAGE <i>text</i></tt>
<dd>Replaces the standard answerback message by <i>text</i>.  NOT RECOMMENDED
because this can be a SECURITY RISK.  If you want to use this option, you
must spell <tt>UNSAFE-MESSAGE</tt> all the way out -- no abbreviations.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL APC <i>{</i> OFF, ON, UNCHECKED <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Controls execution of Application Program Commands
(<a href="gloss.html#g_apc">APC</a>s)
sent by the host while
Kermit-95's terminal screen is active.  ON allows execution of "safe"
commands and disallows obviously dangerous commands such as <tt>DELETE</tt>,
<tt>RENAME</tt>, <tt>OUTPUT</tt>, and <tt>RUN</tt>.  <tt>OFF</tt> prevents
execution of APCs.  <tt>UNCHECKED</tt> allows execution of all commands.  OFF
is the default.  See <a href="https://kermitproject.org/onlinebooks/uck2ep2.pdf#page=287">
    Chapter 13 of <em>Using C-Kermit</em></a> for a full
explanation.  APCs are not available in all terminal types.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL ARROW-KEYS <i>{</i> APPLICATION, CURSOR <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Sets the mode for the arrow keys during VT terminal emulation so that they
send the "right stuff" when pressed.  Normally the host application should
put them in the right mode; use this command to force the arrow keys into
the desired mode when they do not seem to work with your host application.
<a href="arrow.html">CLICK HERE</a> for a technical explanation.

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL ATTRIBUTE <i>{</i> BLINK, DIM, PROTECTED, REVERSE,
    UNDERLINE, ITALIC, CROSSED-OUT <i>}</i> <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>

<dd>Determines whether real Blinking, Reverse, italic, crossed-out and Underline
are used in the terminal display. When <tt>BLINK</tt> is turned <tt>OFF</tt>, reverse
background intensity is used.  When <tt>REVERSE</tt>, <tt>ITALIC</tt>,
<tt>CROSSED-OUT</tt> and <tt>UNDERLINE</tt>
are <tt>OFF</tt>, the colors selected with <tt>SET TERMINAL COLOR <i>{</i>
REVERSE, UNDERLINE, ITALIC, CROSSED-OUT <i>}</i></tt> are used instead.
This command affects the entire current screen and the entire terminal scrollback buffer.
<p>
<blockquote>
When <tt>BLINK</tt> is <tt>ON</tt>, true blinking is done.  But due to
limitations of console mode, true underlining is simulated by reversing the
intensity of the background color. If you turn <tt>BLINK</tt> <tt>OFF</tt>
while <tt>UNDERLINE</tt> is <tt>ON</tt>, then, because <tt>BLINK</tt> is now
represented by reversing the intensity of the background color, blink and
underline would look the same, so <tt>UNDERLINE</tt> reverts to <tt>OFF</tt>.
K95G, the GUI version of Kermit 95, supports true underlining so does not have
this problem.
</blockquote>
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL ATTRIBUTE PROTECTED <i>{</i> BOLD, DIM, INVISIBLE, NORMAL, REVERSE, ... <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Tells how protected fields should be shown.
<p>  
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL AUTODOWNLOAD <i>{</i> ON, OFF, KERMIT <i>options</i>, ZMODEM <i>options</i> <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Tells whether Kermit and ZMODEM download initiations should be recognized
during terminal emulation (and INPUT command execution).  ON, the default,
means they are.  This feature allows Kermit 95 to switch immediately into
Kermit or ZMODEM receive mode and then switch back to terminal emulation
automatically when the transfer is finished.  This command also applies to
automatic uploading when using the Kermit protocol (or more precisely, to
automatic Kermit server activation.
Special options can be specified separately for Kermit and ZMODEM protocols:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>C0-CONFLICT <i>{</i> IGNORED-BY-EMULATOR, PROCESSED-BY-EMULATOR <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>How C0 control characters (such as Ctrl-A or Ctrl-X) are treated by the
terminal emulator when they have conflicting interpretations.  For example,
in DG or Wyse emulation, a Ctrl-A or Ctrl-X starts a host-directed print
operation, but Ctrl-A is also the start of a Kermit packet and Ctrl-X is
also the start of a ZMODEM packet.  <tt>PROCESSED-BY-EMULATOR</tt> is the
default <tt>C0-CONFLICT</tt> action.  NOTE: There are no conflicts in VT or
ANSI emulation.
<p>
<dt><tt>DETECTION <i>{</i> PACKET, STRING <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>The autodownload detection method for this protocol: <tt>PACKET</tt>
(i.e. a valid Kermit or Zmodem packet), or <tt>STRING</tt> -- that is, a
specific string of characters.  The default detection method is
<tt>PACKET</tt>.
<p>
<dt><tt>STRING <i>string</i></tt>
<dd>When <tt>SET TERM AUTO <i>{</i> KERMIT, ZMODEM <i>}</i> DETECTION
STRING</tt> is elected, this command specifies the string that triggers
automatic entry into file reception mode for the given protocol.  Examples
(showing the defaults for each protocol):
<p>
<pre>
  SET TERM AUTO ZMODEM rz\13
  SET TERM AUTO KERMIT READY TO SEND...
</pre>
<p>
</dl>
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL AUTOPAGE <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>
<dd><tt>AUTOPAGE</tt> mode is used on Wyse and Televideo terminals.
<tt>AUTOPAGE</tt> mode causes the cursor to move to the top of the next page
of terminal memory when it scrolls off the bottom of the current page.  In
K95, it moves the cursor to the top line from the bottom since K95 only
supports a single page of terminal memory.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL AUTOSCROLL <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>
<dd><tt>AUTOSCROLL</tt> mode is used on Televideo terminals when the size of a
page of terminal memory is larger than the view screen.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL BELL <i>{</i> AUDIBLE, VISIBLE, NONE <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Specifies how Control-G (bell) characters are handled.  <tt>AUDIBLE</tt>
means a beep is sounded; <tt>VISIBLE</tt> means the screen is flashed
momentarily.  This command has been superseded by <tt>SET BELL</tt>, which
applies also to the Command screen.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL BYTESIZE <i>{</i> 7, 8 <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>To use 7- or 8-bit terminal characters between Kermit 95 and the other
computer or service in the Terminal screen.  NOTE: To use 8-bit characters,
you must not have <tt>PARITY</tt> set to anything other than <tt>NONE</tt>.
<tt>SET PARITY NONE</tt> is the default.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL CHARACTER-SET <i>remote-set</i></tt>
<dd>Shortcut for
<a href="#trmlcs"><tt>SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET</tt></a> <i>default</i>;
<a href="#trmrcs"><tt>SET TERMINAL REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET</tt></a>
<i>remote-set</i></tt>

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL CLIPBOARD-ACCESS <i>{</i> ALLOW-BOTH, ALLOW-READ,
    ALLOW-WRITE <i>}</i> <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>} NOTIFY</i></tt>
<dd>
    Enable or disable clipboard access by the remote host using OSC-52. You can
    turn read and write on or off individually, or you can set both at once with
    the <tt>ALLOW-BOTH</tt> option. You can optionally choose to be notified
    when theremote host attempts to access the clipboard with the
    <tt>NOTIFY</tt> option. This requires Windows 2000 or newer.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE nnn</tt>
<dd>This command can not be used in Windows 95.  In OS/2 and Windows NT, it
actually loads the given code page into your session.  Make sure to also give a
<a href="#trmlcs"><tt>SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET</tt></a> command to
match.
<p>
<dt><tt><a name="termcolor">SET TERMINAL COLOR  <i>screen-part</i>  <i>foreground-color</i>  <i>background-color</i></tt>
<dd>Choose the fore- and background colors for the designated screen part.
Screen parts are:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>BORDER</tt>
<dd>Screen border, OS/2 only (only one color can be given here, not two
as for the other screen parts).
<p>
<dt><tt>CROSSED-OUT-TEXT</tt>
<dd>Crossed-out text, which must be simulated with color in Console versions of
    K95 on OS/2 and Windows due to restrictions of the Console driver.
<dt><tt>CURSOR</tt>
<dd>K95G only: the text cursor
<p>
<dt><tt>DEBUG-TERMINAL</tt>
<dd>Debugging screens (in which control characters and escape sequences are
displayed graphically).
<p>
<dt><tt>HELP-TEXT</tt>
<dd>Popup help screens
<p>
<dt><tt>ITALIC</tt>
<dd>Italic text, which must be simulated with color in Console versions of
    K95 on OS/2 and Windows due to restrictions of the Console driver.
<p>
<dt><tt>REVERSE-VIDEO</tt>
<dd>Colors to be substituted when the host puts the terminal into reverse
video mode (fore- and background colors switched).  NOT RECOMMENDED because
this can cause numerous distinctions of coloration and highlighting to be
lost in reverse video.
<p>
<dt><tt>STATUS-LINE</tt>
<dd>The Terminal screen status line.
<p>
<dt><tt>SELECTION</tt>
<dd>Mouse selections
<p>
<dt><tt>TERMINAL-SCREEN</tt>
<dd>The main terminal screen.
<p>
<dt><tt>UNDERLINED TEXT</tt>
<dd>Underlined text, which must be simulated with color in Console versions of
    K95 on OS/2 and Windows due to restrictions of the Console driver.

</dl>
<p>
Colors are:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>BLACK</tt><br>
<tt>BLUE</tt><br>
<tt>GREEN</tt><br>
<tt>CYAN</tt><br>
<tt>RED</tt><br>
<tt>MAGENTA</tt><br>
<tt>BROWN</tt><br>
<tt>LIGHTGRAY</tt><br>
<tt>DARKGRAY</tt><br>
<tt>LIGHTBLUE</tt> (high intensity)<br>
<tt>LIGHTGREEN</tt> (high intensity)<br>
<tt>LIGHTCYAN</tt> (high intensity)<br>
<tt>LIGHTRED</tt> (high intensity)<br>
<tt>LIGHTMAGENTA</tt> (high intensity)<br>
<tt>YELLOW</tt> (high intensity)<br>
<tt>WHITE</tt> (high intensity)
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition to the above named colors, in K95G you can also specify RGB colors
using the <tt>RGB</tt> keyword, or colors by number with the <tt>INDEX</tt>
keyword. For example, <tt>SET TERMINAL COLOR TERMINAL-SCREEN RGB 255 110 0 INDEX 0</tt>
would set the foreground to R/G/B color 255/110/0, a shade of amber, and the
background to color 0 which is black. Valid color indexes depend on the
currently selected color palette.
<p>
We do not recommend you use any of the high-intensity colors for the
TERMINAL-SCREEN screen part (the main terminal screen), since this can
confuse matters when the host sends highlighting escape sequences.
<p>
<tt>LIGHT</tt> can
be abbreviated with just <tt>L</tt>, for example <tt>LBLUE</tt>.
<tt>DARK</tt> can be abbreviated by <tt>D</tt>.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL COLOR ERASE <i>{</i> CURRENT-COLOR, DEFAULT-COLOR <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Determines whether the current color as set by the host or the default color
as set by the user (<tt>SET TERMINAL COLOR TERMINAL</tt>) is used to clear the
screen when erase commands are received from the host. 
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL COLOR PALETTE <i>{</i> AIXTERM-16, VT525, VT525-ALTERNATE,
    VT525-MONO, XTERM-256, XTERM-88, XTERM-RGB <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Sets the color palette used to render the terminal screen. In the Windows
    Console and OS/2 versions of Kermit 95 (or K95G built with only 16-color
    support), colors are mapped from the chosen palette to AIXTERM-16 for
    display. The XTERM-RGB option, where available, is the XTERM-256 color
    palette with 24bit RGB color support enabled. When 24bit RGB color support
    is disabled, RGB colors set by the host are mapped to the nearest color in
    the selected palette. Selecting either the VT525-ALTERNATE or VT525-MONO
    palette switches the VT525 color mode to the respective setting. In the
    Alternate setting, attribute combinations are used to select colors and
    normal SGR colors are not displayed.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL COLOR RESET-ON-ESC[0m <i>{</i> CURRENT-COLOR, DEFAULT-COLOR <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Determines whether the current color or the default color is used after an
<tt>ESC [ 0 m</tt> ("reset attributes") command sequence is received from the
host.  For all emulations except for AT386 and SCOANSI, the default value is
<tt>CURRENT-COLOR</tt>, meaning that <tt>ESC [ 0 m</tt> does not affect
coloration.  <tt>DEFAULT-COLOR</tt> means that <tt>ESC [ 0 m</tt> changes to
your current <tt>SET TERMINAL COLOR TERMINAL</tt> color.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL CONTROLS <i>{</i> 7, 8 <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Applies to VT220/320 and Wyse 370 emulation, as well as to AT386, SCOANSI,
HFT, AIXTERM, and other advanced <a href="gloss.html">ANSI</a> X3.64 based
emulations.  Determines
whether function keys, arrow keys, etc, that generate escape
sequences should send 8-bit control characters (such as CSI, 155 decimal) or
their 7-bit equivalents (such as <tt>ESC [</tt> instead of CSI).  Default is 7.
<p>
<dt><tt><a name="trmcrd">SET TERMINAL CR-DISPLAY <i>{</i> CRLF, NORMAL <i>}</i></tt> 
<dd>Specifies how incoming Carriage Return (CR) characters are displayed
on your screen.  <tt>NORMAL</tt> (the default) means a CR is displayed as
itself.  <tt>CRLF</tt> means a CR is displayed as a carriage return and a line
feed (LF).  Use <tt>CRLF</tt> when incoming lines of text write over each
other, for example when two two Kermit programs are connected to each other in
"chat" mode.  Note: this is like
<a href="#trmnlm"><tt>SET TERMINAL NEWLINE-MODE</tt></a>, but in the other
direction.
<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL CURSOR <i>{</i> FULL, HALF, UNDERLINE <i>}</i> <i>[</i> <i>{</i> NOBLINK, ON, OFF <i>}</i> <i>]</i></tt>
<dd>Selects cursor style and turns the cursor on unless the trailing keyword
OFF is included, in which case the cursor is turned off.  If the trailing
keyword NOBLINK is included, the the specified style of cursor is enabled but
does not blink.

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL DEBUG <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Controls terminal session debugging.  You can also use Alt-D (or whatever
other key that <tt>\Kdebug</tt> is assigned to) in the Terminal screen to
toggle session debugging on and off.
<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL DG-UNIX-MODE <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Specifies whether the Data General emulations should accept control
sequences in Unix compatible format or in native DG format.  The
default is OFF, DG format.
<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL ECHO <i>{</i> LOCAL, REMOTE <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Specifies which side does the echoing during terminal connection.  If
every character you type appears twice, then "set term echo remote".
If you do not see the characters you type, then "set term echo local".
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL ESCAPE-CHARACTER <i>{</i> ENABLED, DISABLED <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Since we can use Alt-key or other non-ASCII keys or combinations in
K-95 to escape back, etc, we don't necessarily need to reserve one
ASCII control character for that purpose, even though we do by default
(<tt>Ctrl-]</tt>) for compatibility with MS-DOS Kermit.  Use <tt>SET TERM ESC
DISABLED</tt> to disable the CONNECT-mode escape character, so you can type
all ASCII control characters without having to double any of them.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL FONT <i>{</i> CP437, CP850, CP852, CP862, CP866, DEFAULT <i>}</i></tt> <b>(OS/2 only)</b>
<dd>CP437 - Original PC code page<br>
CP850 - "Multilingual" (West Europe) code page<br>
CP852 - East Europe Roman Alphabet code page (for Czech, Polish, etc)<br>
CP862 - Hebrew code page<br>
CP866 - Cyrillic (Russian, Belorussian, and Ukrainian) code page<br>
Loads a soft into the video adapter for use during terminal emulation.
Use this command when your OS/2 system does not have the desired code page.
Can be used only in full-screen sessions.  Also see <tt>SET</tt>
<tt>TERMINAL</tt> <tt>CODE-PAGE</tt> and <tt>SET</tt> <tt>TERMINAL</tt>
<tt>REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET</tt>.

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL FONT <i>font-name</i> <i>height</i> <b>(K95G only)</b></tt>
<dd>Sets the font and font height (in points) to that specified. This is a
  synonym for <tt>SET GUI font</tt></dd>
<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL HEIGHT <i>number</i></tt>
<dd>Changes the number of rows (lines) to use during terminal emulation, not
counting the status line.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL IDLE-TIMEOUT <i>number</i></tt>
<dd>Sets the limit on idle time in CONNECT mode to the given number of
seconds.  0 (the default) means no limit.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL IDLE-ACTION
<i>{</i> EXIT, HANGUP, OUTPUT <i>[ text ]</i>, RETURN <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Specifies the action to be taken when a CONNECT session is idle for the
number of seconds given by SET TERMINAL IDLE-TIMEOUT.  The default action
is to RETURN to command mode.  EXIT exits from Kermit; HANGUP hangs up the
connection, and OUTPUT sends the given text to the host without leaving
CONNECT mode; if no text is given a NUL (0) character is sent.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL IDLE-ACTION
<i>{</i> TELNET-NOP, TELNET-AYT <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>(Telnet connections only) Sends the indicated Telnet protocol message: No
Operation (NOP) or
"Are You There?" (AYT).

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL KDB-FOLLOWS-GL/GR <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Specifies whether or not the keyboard character set should follow the
active GL and GR character sets.  This feature is OFF by default and
should not be used unless it is specificly required by the host
application.


<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL KEY <i>terminal-type-or-keyboard-mode</i>  -<br>
<i>[</i> /LITERAL <i>]</i> <i>keycode</i> <i>[</i> <i>definition-string</i> <i>]</i></tt>
<dd>Like <tt>SET KEY</tt>, but specific to the given terminal type or keyboard
mode.  <tt>/LITERAL</tt> means that no character-set translations should be
applied when using this key. 
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL KEYBOARD-MODE <i>{</i> NORMAL, EMACS, HEBREW, RUSSIAN, WP <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Selects the named special keyboard mode (<tt>WP</tt> = Word Perfect).

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL KEYPAD-MODE <i>{</i> APPLICATION, NUMERIC <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>When emulating terminals that have a numeric keypad, use this command
to force the keypad into the proper mode, in case the host application
did not do this with an escape sequence, as it should have.  The situation
is similar to that with the <a href="arrow.html">arrow keypad</a>.
<p>
<dt><tt><a name="trmlcs">SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER SET <i>name</i></tt>
<dd>This command tells Kermit 95 which character set used by the session
(screen, window, etc) on your PC in which Kermit 95 is running.  Kermit 95
translates between this character set and the <a href="#trmrcs"><tt>TERMINAL
REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET</tt></a> during terminal emulation.  The local character
set is a PC Code Page (the letters "cp" followed by a number; character sets
that are not code pages can not be used as local character sets unless you
know something we don't).  In any case, you normally should not need to give
this command, since (a) Kermit 95 probably knows what your PC code page is,
and (b) you can't change it anyway.
In Windows NT, this command affects only keyboard-to-host translation;
incoming material is translated to UNICODE.

<p>
<dt><tt><a name="trmlfd">SET TERMINAL LF-DISPLAY <i>{</i> CRLF, NORMAL <i>}</i></tt></dt>
<dd>Specifies how incoming linefeed characters are to be displayed
    on your screen. <tt>NORMAL</tt> (the default) means a LF is displayed as
    itself.  <tt>CRLF</tt> means a LF is displayed as a carriage return and a line
    feed (LF). Note: this is like
    <a href="#trmcrd"><tt>SET TERMINAL CR-DISPLAY</tt></a>

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL LINE-SPACING</tt> <i>number</i></dt>
<dd>GUI only.  The number can be from 1 to 3, and can include a fractional
part, e.g. 1.25.  1 is the default and the minimum line spacing.  Any other
number tells Kermit 95 add the specified amount of spacing between screen
lines.

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL LOCKING-SHIFT <i>{</i> OFF, ON <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Tells Kermit 95 whether to send Shift-In/Shift-Out (Ctrl-O and Ctrl-N) to
switch between 7-bit and 8-bit characters sent during terminal emulation
over 7-bit connections.  Explained in <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>,
<a href="https://kermitproject.org/onlinebooks/uck2ep2.pdf#page=147">Chapters 8</a>
and <a href="https://kermitproject.org/onlinebooks/uck2ep2.pdf#page=295">16</a>.  <tt>OFF</tt> by default.

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL MARGIN-BELL <i>{</i> ON <i>[</i> <i>column</i> ], OFF <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Allows user to turn typewriter-like margin bell on and off, and when turned
<tt>ON</tt>, also to specify the column at which the bell is rung, e.g. "set
term margin-bell on 72".

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL MOUSE <i>{</i> OFF, ON <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Tells Kermit 95 whether to control the mouse itself (<tt>ON</tt>) or
to ignore it.  If the operating system is handling mouse events, then Kermit 95
won't see them.

<p>
<dt><tt><a name="trmnlm">SET TERMINAL NEWLINE-MODE <i>{</i> OFF, ON <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Tells what to send when you press the Enter key while in the Terminal
screen.  Normally only carriage return (CR) is sent.  <tt>SET TERM NEWLINE
ON</tt> means to send CR and linefeed (LF).  Use this command only if the
Enter key does not seem to produce the appropriate effect in the Terminal
screen.  Note: this is like
<a href="#trmcrd"><tt>SET TERMINAL CR-DISPLAY</tt></a>,
but in the other direction.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL OUTPUT-PACING <i>milliseconds</i></tt>
<dd>Tells how long to pause between sending each character to the host when the
Terminal screen is active.  Normally not needed but sometimes required to
work around "TRANSMISSION BLOCKED" conditions when using the mouse to paste
into the terminal screen.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL PAGE ACTIVE <i>page</i></tt>
<dd> Moves the cursor to the specified page. If Page Cursor Coupling is enabled,
     the display will move to that page also. The cursor is not sent to home.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL PAGE COUNT <i>number</i></tt>
<dd> Specifies the number of pages available, up to the maximum supported by the
    currently selected terminal type.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL PAGE CURSOR-COUPLING <i>{</i> OFF, ON <i>}</i></tt>
<dd> Enables or disables Page Cursor Coupling. When enabled, moving the cursor

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL PCTERM <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Used to activate or deactivate the PCTERM
terminal emulation keyboard mode.  When PCTERM is ON all keystrokes when
in CONNECT mode are sent to the host as "make/break" sequences (down/up
codes) instead of as
characters from the REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET.  When PCTERM is ON all keyboard
mappings including kverbs and escape characters are disabled.  To turn off
PCTERM keyboard mode while in CONNECT mode press Ctrl-CapsLock.  The
default is OFF.
<p>
<dt><tt><a name="trmrcs">SET TERMINAL REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET <i>name</i> <i>[</i> <i>{</i> G0, G1, G2, G3, ALL <i>}</i> <i>]</i></tt>
<dd>Specifies the character set used by the host or application that Kermit 95
is connected to, and assign it to one of the tables
<a href="iso2022.html">G0 through G3</a>, or
to <tt>ALL</tt> four of them.  By default,
<a href="gloss.html#g_ascii">ASCII</a> is assigned to G0, any other
national 7-bit set is assigned to <tt>ALL</tt>, and any 8-bit set is assigned
to G1, G2, and G3.  The host switches among G0,G1,G2,G3 by setting the 8th bit
of a character to 0 or 1, or with Shift-In/Shift-Out, or with escape
sequences.  The host can also designate characters to the G<i>n</i> tables, and
normally it will do so if it expects to find them there.  So in most cases you
need not be concerned with what's in G0..G3.  This command is to force correct
behavior in cases where the host application is doing something wrong.  Type
<tt>SET</tt> <tt>TERM</tt> <tt>REMOTE-CHAR ?</tt> or
<a href="charsets.html">CLICK HERE</a> to get the list of character sets you can
choose from.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL PRINT <i>{</i> AUTO, COPY, OFF, USER <i>}</i></tt>

<dd>Allows selective control of various types of printing from the Terminal
session.  AUTO prints a line of text from the terminal screen whenever
the cursor is moved off the line.  COPY prints every byte received as
it is received without interpretation.  USER prints every byte after
interpretation by the terminal emulator translates character-sets and
construct escape sequences, ...  The default is OFF.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL ROLL-MODE <i>{</i> INSERT, OVERWRITE <i>}</i></tt>

<dd>Tells what to do when you have the Terminal screen rolled back and then
new data arrives from the keyboard communication device: Enter it into the
scrollback buffer at the current rollback position (<tt>OVERWRITE</tt>) or
insert it at the end of the buffer (<tt>INSERT</tt>).  The default is
<tt>INSERT</tt>.  Typing is allowed during rollback in either mode.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL ROLL-MODE KEYSTROKES
<i>{</i> RESTORE-AND-SEND, IGNORE, SEND <i>}</i></tt>

<dd>Tells what to do when you have the Terminal screen rolled back and
keystrokes are entered on the keyboard: restore the screen to its active
position and then send the keystroke(s); ignore the keystrokes, or send
them without restoring the screen.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL SCREEN-MODE <i>{</i> NORMAL, REVERSE <i>}</i></tt>

<dd>When set to <tt>REVERSE</tt> the foreground and background colors are
swapped including the application of the foreground and background intensity
bits.  The default is <tt>NORMAL</tt>.

<p>

<dt><tt><a name="sttopt">SET TERMINAL SCREEN-OPTIMIZE <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>

<dd><tt>ON</tt> means only write those cells to the screen that have changed
since the last update.  <tt>OFF</tt> means to refresh the entire screen when
updating.  <tt>ON</tt> is the default.  Choose whichever method performs best
on your computer.  If you are using a speech or Braille device, you should use
<tt>ON</tt>. Has no effect on K95G which always refreshes the entire screen.

<p>
<dt><tt><a name="sttupd">SET TERMINAL SCREEN-UPDATE <i>{</i> FAST, SMOOTH <i>}</i> <i>[</i> <i>milliseconds</i> <i>]</i></tt>
<dd>Chooses the mechanism used for screen updating and the update frequency.
<tt>SMOOTH</tt> means the screen is repainted every time a character arrives.
<tt>FAST</tt> means the screen is repainted at fixed intervals.  The default
is <tt>FAST</tt> with an interval of 100 milliseconds (1/10 second).  Use
<tt>SMOOTH</tt> to give priority to echoing; use <tt>FAST</tt> to give
priority to throughput.  Vary the interval to achieve optimum results for your
PC.  On VT100 and above, the host may use escape sequences to switch Kermit
between <tt>FAST</tt> and <tt>SMOOTH</tt>; <tt>FAST</tt> is selected by the
Jump-scrolling escape sequence; <tt>SMOOTH</tt> is selected by the VT100
smooth-scrolling sequence.  However, note that K95 does not presently
implement smooth scrolling in the VT100 sense.  If the host switches K95 from
<tt>SMOOTH</tt> to <tt>FAST</tt>, the most recently specified (or if none,
default) update interval is used.  If you are using a speech or Braille
device, you should <tt>SET TERMINAL SCREEN-UPDATE SMOOTH</tt>. SMOOTH is not
supported by K95G at this time.

<p>
<dt><tt><a name="t_scroll">SET TERMINAL SCROLLBACK <i>lines</i></tt>
<dd>Sets size of Terminal screen rollback (scrollback) buffer.  <i>lines</i>
includes the active terminal screen.  The minimum is 256.  The maximum is
two million, but if you choose a very big number, make sure your PC has
sufficient memory and swap space.  The default is 512 lines.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL SEND-DATA <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Some terminal types support forms-filling features in which the host may
request the terminal to transmit selected fields.  Since this is a potential
security loophole, Kermit 95 by default (<tt>OFF</tt>) sends spaces instead of
the actual contents of the screen.  Setting this option to <tt>ON</tt>
instructs Kermit 95 to send the actual data.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL SEND-END-OF-BLOCK <i>{</i> CRLF_ETX  US_CR <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Specifies the characters to use as end of line and end of block indicators
when sending data to the host.  The default is <tt>US_CR</tt>.  The options
are combinations of names of <a href="gloss.html#g_ascii">ASCII</a>
<a href="gloss.html#g_ctrlchar">control characters</a>.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL SGR-COLORS <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>SGR means Set Graphic Rendition.  It is the name of the 
<a href="gloss.html#g_ansi">ANSI</a> X3.64 escape
sequence that is used to select normal, reverse, bold, underlined, blinking,
or other character-cell attributes, including color, such as we are used to
seeing on BBS's when we use "ANSI" terminal emulation.  The color-setting SGR
sequences,
<tt>&#60;CSI&#62;3&#60;x&#62;;4&#60;y&#62;m</tt>, are also recognized by
Kermit 95 when it is emulating a VT100 or higher VT terminal model, even
though most real VT terminals do not display color, and in fact they ignore
these sequences.  To make Kermit 95 ignore color setting sequences, in effect
turning into a monochrome terminal, use <tt>SET TERMINAL SGR-COLORS OFF</tt>.
This command affects all ANSI-style emulations, including ANSI, SCOANSI, AT386,
etc, as well as Wyse 370 and VT100/102/220/320.

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL SIZE <i>columns rows</i></tt>
<dd>Sets the number of columns and rows in the terminal screen. This is
    shorthand for
    <tt>SET TERMINAL WIDTH <i>columns</i>, SET TERMINAL HEIGHT <i>rows</i></tt>

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL SNI-CH.CODE <i>{ ON, OFF }</i></tt>
<dd>This command controls the state of the CH.CODE key.  It is the equivalent
to the SNI_CH_CODE Keyboard verb.  The SNI terminal uses CH.CODE to
easily switch between the National Language character set and U.S. ASCII.
The default is ON which means to display characters as U.S. ASCII.  When
OFF the lanuage specified by SET TERMINAL SNI-LANUAGE is used to display
characters when 7-bit character sets are in use.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL SNI-FIRMWARE-VERSIONS <i>kbd-version terminal-version</i></tt>
<dd>Specifies the Firmware Version number that should be reported to the host
when the terminal is queried.  The default is 920031 for the keyboard
and 830851 for the terminal.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL SNI-LANGUAGE <i>national-language</i></tt>
<dd>An alias for SET TERMINAL VT-LANUAGE, this command specifies the national
language character-set that should be used when the NRC mode is activated
for VT emulations or when CH.CODE is OFF for SNI emulations.  The default
language for SET TERMINAL TYPE SNI-97801 is "German".

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL SNI-PAGEMODE { ON, OFF }</tt>
<dd>Determines whether or not page mode is active.  OFF by default.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL SNI-SCROLLMODE { ON, OFF }</tt>
<dd>Determines whether or not scroll mode is active.  OFF by default.

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL STATUSLINE <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>
<tt>SET TERMINAL STATUSLINE OFF</tt> removes the Terminal window status line
so the extra screen line can be available to host applications.
<tt>SET TERMINAL STATUSLINE ON</tt> turns the status line back on.  You can
also toggle the status line off and on the with \Kstatus verb, normally
assigned to Alt-S.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL TRANSMIT-TIMEOUT <i>seconds</i></tt>
<dd>Specifies the maximum amount of time C-Kermit waits before returning to the
prompt if your keystrokes can't be transmitted for some reason, such as a
flow-control deadlock.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL TRIGGER <i>[</i> <i>string</i> <i>]</i></tt>
<dd>Tells Kermit to look for the given string during all subsequent CONNECT
sessions, and if seen, to return to command mode automatically, as if you
had escaped back manually.  If the string includes any spaces, you must
enclose it in braces.  Example:
<p>
<pre>
  SET TERMINAL TRIGGER {NO CARRIER}
</pre>
<p>
If a string is to include a literal brace character, precede it with a
backslash:
<p>
<pre>
  ; My modem always makes this noise when the connection is lost:
  SET TERMINAL TRIGGER |||ppp\{\{\{\{UUUUUUU
</pre>
<p>
If you want Kermit to look for more than one string simultaneously, use the
following syntax:
<p>
<pre>
  SET TERMINAL TRIGGER {{<i>string1</i>}{<i>string2</i>}...{<i>stringn</i>}}
</pre>
<p>
In this case, Kermit returns to command mode automatically if any of the given
strings is encountered.  Up to 8 strings may be specified.  If the most recent
return to command mode was caused by a trigger, the <tt>\v(trigger)</tt>
variable contains the trigger value; otherwise <tt>\v(trigger)</tt> is empty.
The <tt>SHOW TRIGGER</tt> command displays the <tt>SET TERMINAL TRIGGER</tt>
values as well as the current <tt>\v(trigger)</tt> value.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL TYPE</tt>
<dd><a href="#trmtyp">(See top of this file)</a>.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL UNIX-MODE <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>This affects emulation of terminals that have a "UNIX mode", currently only
the Data General DASHER 217.  <tt>OFF</tt> (the default) means the terminal
operates in its native mode, <tt>ON</tt> switches it to UNIX mode.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL URL-HIGHLIGHT { ON <i>attribute</i>, OFF }</tt>
<dd>Specifies whether K-95 should highlight URLs and which screen attribute
should be used.  The screen attributes can be one of NORMAL, BLINK, BOLD,
DIM, INVISIBLE, REVERSE, or UNDERLINE.  The default is ON using the
BOLD screen attribute.

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL VIDEO-CHANGE <i>{</i> DISABLED, ENABLED <i>}</i></tt>

<dd>Tells whether Kermit 95 should change between 80- and 132-column windows
automatically in response to escape sequences from the other computer.
<tt>DISABLED</tt> means it should not; <tt>ENABLED</tt> means it should.  The
default is <tt>ENABLED</tt>.  When <tt>TERMINAL</tt> <tt>VIDEO-CHANGE</tt> is
<tt>DISABLED</tt>, the emulator switches modes without changing the window
size, and wide screens can be viewed by <a href="scroll.html">scrolling
horizontally</a>. Not supported in K95G.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL VT-LANGUAGE <i>language</i></tt>
<dd>Specifies the National Replacement Character Set (NRC) to be used when
NRC mode is activated.  The default is "North American".

<p>

<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL VT-NRC-MODE { ON, OFF }</tt>
<dd>OFF (default) chooses VT multinational Character Set mode.  ON chooses
VT National Replacement Character-set mode.  The NRC is selected with
SET TERMINAL VT-LANGUAGE.

<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL WIDTH <i>cols</i></tt>
<dd>Tells how many columns define the terminal size.  80 is the default width.
132 is the normal choice for wider screens.
<p>
<dt><tt>SET TERMINAL WRAP <i>{</i> OFF, ON <i>}</i></tt>
<dd>Tells whether the terminal emulator should automatically wrap long lines on
your screen.
