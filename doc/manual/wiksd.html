<tt>Windows Internet Kermit Service - Overview</tt></a></h2>

Internet Kermit Service (IKS) is an Internet standard file transfer and 
management service defined in
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2839">RFC2839</a> and
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2840">RFC2840</a>.  It's similar
to an FTP server except:

<p>
<ul>

<li>It uses Kermit protocol instead of FTP protocol, thus offering numerous
capabilities scarce or totally lacking in FTP.

<li>It offers not only the FTP-like client/server mode of operation,
but also an interactive file-transfer and management shell to Telnet clients.

<li>The server can be automated by client-provided scripts.

</ul>
<p>

A well-known publicly accessible Internet Kermit Service <em>was</em>
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/cuiksd.html">the Unix-based
one at Columbia University</a>.

<p>

As of Kermit 95 1.1.21, Internet Kermit Service is also available for Windows.
The <b>Windows Internet Kermit Service Daemon</b> (WIKSD):

<p>
<ul>
<li>Is available only for Windows NT, 2000, XP and newer.
<li>Runs as a service.
<li>Accepts connections only from the Internet.
<li>Authenticates against the Windows user database.
<li>Offers scriptable Kermit-based file-transfer and management services.
<li>A secure version is available.
</ul>
<p>

WIKSD is new with Kermit 95 1.1.21 (April 2002).  Previously Kermit 95
handled remote access through a "host mode" script:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Host mode is available for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP and newer.
<li>It runs as a user process.
<li>It accepts both Internet and serial (modem or direct) connections.
<li>It authenticates against its own user database.
<li>It offers limited functionality through a simple menu.
<li>Secure versions are not available.
</ul>
<p>

Although host mode is still available, it is "deprecated" in favor of WIKSD.
It is documented in the Kermit 95 manual.

<p>

The WIKSD documentation is:

<p>
<dl>

<dt><a href="wiksdadm.html">The WIKSD Administrator's Guide</a>
<dd>Setting up and administering remote access with WIKSD.

<p>

<dt><a href="wiksduse.html">The WIKSD User's Guide</a>
<dd>How to use WIKSD to manage and transfer files.

</dl>
<p>

WIKSD is simply Kermit 95 (<tt>K95.EXE</tt>), accessed remotely.  When K95 is
acting as WIKSD, it is strictly a "remote mode Kermit" -- that is, it can
not make connections, and you can not activate its terminal emulator.  For
this reason, certain Kermit 95 commands don't work and generate error messages
when given to IKSD, for example:

<p>
<ul>
<li>SET PORT, SET HOST, TELNET, SSH, RLOGIN, ...
<li>SET TERMINAL, SET KEY. ...
<li>SET DIAL, SET MODEM, ...
<li>SET NETWORK, SET TELNET, SET TELOPT, SET AUTHENTICATION, ...
</ul>
<p>

In other words, any commands having to do with setting up, making, or
using connections.  Also RUN and PUSH are disallowed.

<p>

WIKSD's command restrictions can cause problems for people who use the
same PC locally (from its physical keyboard, mouse, and screen) and remotely
(who come in through WIKSD): if their K95CUSTOM.INI files contains any of
the above commands, lots of error messages will appear when logging in to
WIKSD.  The way to avoid this is to separate the forbidden commands from
the always-legal ones, as in this example:

<p>
<pre>
  ; FILE K95CUSTOM.INI -- Kermit 95 Customizations
  ;
  <i>(Commands acceptable to both K95 and WIKSD here)</i>

  IF IKSD END 0 IKSD Setup Complete.

  <i>(Commands not acceptable WIKSD here)</i>
</pre>
