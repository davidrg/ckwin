    <title>Kermit 95 - The "k95" Terminal Type</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<h2>The "k95" Terminal Type</h2>

<p>

This is Kermit 95s <em>own</em> terminal personality which, while not emulating
xterm, aims to be broadly compatible with software written for other
"xterm compatible" terminals. And while not aiming specifically to emulate
xterm, the K95 terminal type is in general more xterm-compatible than many other
"xterm compatible" terminals.

<p>
The K95 terminal type is largely a VT320 with various extensions from the VT420,
VT520, xterm and other terminals. It includes its own terminfo entry enabling
curses applications to take full advantage of its capabilities, which include:

<ul>
    <li>Support for full 24-bit direct RGB color</li>
    <li>Settable color palette</li>
    <li>Optional host-writable status line. When turned on or off, it alters
        the window size, rather than adding/removing terminal lines like other
        emulations.
    </li>
    <li>Both of xterms Meta key modes</li>
    <li>A more xterm-compatible default keymap</li>
    <li>VT420 rectangular area operations</li>
    <li>Some VT525 color control sequences</li>
    <li>A selection of additional control sequences for improved
        compatibility with xterm</li>
</ul>

<p>Many (but not all) of these features are available in K95s other ANSI
    terminal emulations, but as (for example) the VT320 terminfo file doesn't
    contain capabilities for changing the color palette, applications tend not
    to make use of those features.

<h3><a name="terminfo"><hr>Terminfo Description</h3>
<p>
While at the time of writing the K95 terminal type is quite compatible with the
common <tt>xterm-256color</tt> terminfo entry, there <em>are</em> differences
which could potentially impact some applications. And there is always the
possibility that future xterm releases will change its terminfo entry in ways
that are incompatible with Kermit 95.

<p>So for the best compatibility when using the K95 terminal type, you should
    make sure to install Kermit 95s terminfo description. If the remote host
    is unix, and you've got both C-Kermit (not gkermit) and the terminfo
    entry-description compiler (<tt>kermit</tt> and <tt>tic</tt>) in your PATH,
    and you're sitting at the shell you can run from the following command from
    the K95 command screen to install it: <tt>take terminfo.ksc</tt>.

<p>This script will transmit the terminfo description (<tt>k95.src</tt>)
    to the remote host and install it using <tt>tic -x</tt>. If you don't have
    write access to install it globally (in <tt>/usr/share/terminfo</tt>), it
    should end up in your personal terminfo directory (<tt>$HOME/.terminfo</tt>).

<p>The <tt>terminfo.ksc</tt> script itself only contains two commands:
<pre>   output kermit -C "receive /command /as-name:{tic -x -},exit"\{13}
   send \v(exedir)/k95.src</pre>

<p>The first runs kermit on the remote host, tells it to receive a file and
    pipe it through the command <tt>tic -x -</tt>, then exit. And the
    second command sends the terminfo file.

<p>If you don't have C-Kermit on the remote host, you can transmit the file by
    some other means, and then install it with <tt>tic -x k95.src</tt>.

<h3><a name="emacs"><hr>Emacs compatibility</h3>
<p> Unfortunately, installing the terminfo entry alone isn't enough for Emacs
to work nicely with the K95 terminal type, as Emacs relies on its own
knowledge of different terminals rather than relying only on terminfo. So if
you're an Emacs user, you'll need to add a few things to your <tt>.emacs</tt>
file to get the best results:

<pre>
    ;; Treat k95 like any other xterm-compatible terminal and use keybindings
    ;; suitable for xterm-compatible terminals.
    (add-to-list 'term-file-aliases '("k95" . "xterm"))

    ;; When Emacs is on screen, tell K95 to change its keymap so that it does
    ;; what Emacs expects the meta key to do (Alt+x sends ESC x). When Emacs
    ;; exits or is suspended, it will switch K95 back to its normal keyboard
    ;; mode.
    (add-hook 'tty-setup-hook '(lambda()
        (when (equal "k95" (getenv "TERM" (selected-frame)))
            (send-string-to-terminal "\e[?1036h")
            (push "\e[?1036l" (terminal-parameter nil 'tty-mode-reset-strings))
            (push "\e[?1036h" (terminal-parameter nil 'tty-mode-set-strings)))))
</pre>

<p>The second part is optional. It causes Emacs to ask K95 for different
    handling of the Alt key when its on screen. This is similar to Kermit 95s
    special Emacs keyboard mode. This does override many of K95s default
    shortcut keys though.

<!-- TODO: Update this with any changes to how the meta-sends-esc mode works,
        along with details on how to turn that mode on and off manually -->
