<h1>The Electronic Edition of <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite></h1>

<blockquote>
[ <a href="uck2ep1.pdf">QUICK LINK</a> ] &nbsp;
<i>(keep reading if the link doesn't work)</i>
</blockquote>
<p>

<cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>, 2nd Edition, is a published book, with all
rights held by the publisher, Digital Press (an imprint of Elsevier Science).
A printed copy of this book was included with each shrinkwrapped copy of
Kermit 95, version 1.1.17 and earlier.  It doubles as the user manual for
C-Kermit (for UNIX, VMS, VOS, etc), and the technical reference manual for
Kermit 95 (because it describes the command and scripting language used by
both programs).

<p>
<blockquote>

NOTE: <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>, 2nd Edition, was published in 1997 and is
current with C-Kermit 6.0 and Kermit 95 1.1.8.  Pending the publication of a
third edition, updates are documented in the
<a href="ckermi70.htm">C-Kermit 7.0 Supplement to <cite>Using C-Kermit,
2nd Edition</cite></a>, and in the
<a href="ckermi80.htm">C-Kermit 8.0 Supplement</a>.

</blockquote>

<h3><hr>DOWNLOADING <cite>USING C-KERMIT</cite></h3>

<b>To reduce costs</b> (and therefore price), the current version of Kermit 95
does not include <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite> Instead, buyers of the Kermit 95
2.1 shrinkwrapped package are permitted to <b>download</b> an electronic
edition of <i>Using C-Kermit</i> at no direct cost from:

<p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.manning.com/download/"><tt>http://www.manning.com/download/</tt></a>
</blockquote>
<p>

This version of the manual is in PDF format and can be accessed by Adobe
Acrobat Reader.

<p>

<b>To download</b>, you must be ready to provide your <b>Kermit 95 serial
number</b>, such as "K95-00007654321-2.1", and you must <b>agree to receive
email</b> from the book publisher, Digital Press.  The download consists of
two files, <tt>uck2ep1.pdf</tt> and <tt>uck2ep2.pdf</tt>, which should be
stored in the the <tt>DOCS\MANUAL</tt> subdirectory of the Kermit 95 program
directory, usually:

<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>C:\Program Files\Kermit 95 2.1\DOCS\MANUAL\</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>

so the links in the Kermit 95 will be able to find it.  The size of the
download is approximately 20MB (it's a 622-page book).

<h3><hr>BULK AND SITE LICENSEES</h3>

The PDF version of the book is <i>not</i> included with electronically
delivered versions of Kermit 95, nor with academic site or bulk right-to-copy
licenses.  This is because the PDF version of the book has the same legal and
copyright status as a printed paper copy, and costs just as much.  Therefore
it is available only to those who purchase Kermit 95 in shrinkwrapped form,
whose price covers the cost of the book.  Like the printed book before it, the
PDF version of the book is not included with bulk or academic site licenses,
since this would increase the cost of those licenses prohibitively.  Books
can be purchased separately in printed or PDF form; see the
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">Kermit Website</a> for details.


<h3><hr>PURCHASING <cite>USING C-KERMIT</cite> AS AN E-BOOK</h3>

At this writing, it has been agreed that the PDF version of <cite>Using
C-Kermit</cite> will also be available as a separate "e-book" product for those
who did not receive it by purchasing Kermit 95 1.1.20 or later in shrinkwrapped
retail form.  The details will be posted on the Kermit 95 website as soon as
they are available:

<p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95.html"><tt>http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95.html</tt></a>
</blockquote>
<p>

<h3><hr>ACCESSING <cite>USING C-KERMIT</cite></h3>

Here is the link to the PDF version of <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>:</b>

<p>
<blockquote>
<a href="uck2ep1.pdf"><cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>, 2nd Edition (PDF)</a>
</blockquote>
<p>

If you click on this link, one of four things will happen:

<p>
<ol>

<li>Your Web browser will report that it is not found.  This is to be
expected all copies of K95 1.1.20.  In this case you must download or
purchase the PDF version, as explained above, if you wish to have access
to it.

<p>

<li>Adobe Acrobat Reader will start with the cover of
<cite>Using C-Kermit</cite> on the screen.  This means you have the PDF
manual and a PDF reader.  For convenience, you may wish to add a bookmark
to your Web browser.  Skip the next two sections and read
<a href="#using">Using the PDF Manual</a>.

<p>

<li>Adobe Acrobat Reader will start, but it will display a message to the
effect that the electronic version of <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite> is not
licensed for use with your copy of Kermit 95.  Read
<a href="#nopdf">If You Don't Have the PDF Manual</a>.

<p>

<li>An error will occur because you do not have a copy of Adobe Acrobat
Reader installed.  Go to
<a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe.Com</a> to download a free copy of
Acrobat Reader.

</ol>

<h3><a name="using"><p><hr>USING THE PDF EDITION</a></h3>

When you start the PDF reader, you should see two windows.  The narrow one
on the left is the bookmarks column, for quick access to each chapter.  You
can make it disappear (or return after disappearing) with the leftmost buttons
on the Acrobat Reader toolbar.

<p>

The larger window on the right contains the book.  You can use the stretch
bars or corner to change the size or dimensions to suit your screen or
preferences.  These are actual page images from the printed book, so the type
might be small on some screens.  In that case you can use the Zoom-In tool on
the Acrobat Reader toolbar, or you can print the desired pages.

<p>

The book comes in two pieces: the front matter (cover, table of contents,
preface), and then the book's chapters (page 1 through the end).  The two
pieces are connected by links: one at the end of the first, the other at the
beginning of the second.  You must click on these links to move from one
piece to the other.

<p>

The table of contents is clickable, sending you straight to the desired
chapter or section.  The index at the end, however, is not clickable.  But it
can still be used: find the desired reference in the normal manner, and then
tell Acrobat Reader to "go to" the corresponding page (Ctrl-5 does this in
Windows).

<p>

Searching (with the binoculars button on toolbar) works within the current
piece (front matter or book).  Copying to the clipboard works if you select
the "text selection tool" <tt>[abc]</tt> on the toolbar.

<p>

Note that certain items in the book have been scanned and "pasted" in: the
illustrations, the Cyrillic text, and the Hebrew text.  Certain operations
might not work as expected on these items, e.g. searching for or copying
Cyrillic text.

<p>

Everything else you need to know can be found in Acrobat Reader's Help menu.
