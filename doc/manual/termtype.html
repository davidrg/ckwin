<h2>Kermit 95 Terminal Types</h2>

<a name="ttlist">Kermit 95 supports about 40 terminal emulations,
with several <a href="#restrictions">restrictions</a></a>:

<p>

<dl>

<dt><b>ADM3A</b>
<dd>The Lear-Siegler ADM-3A terminal.

workstations, and the AIXTERM termcap / terminfo entry.

<p>

<dt><b>ANNARBOR</b>

<p>Partial emulation of the Ann Arbor Ambassador terminal, sufficient for
ordinary "termcap"-like applications, but not recommended for general Ann
Arbor emulation; numerous Ann-Arbor-specific features are not presently
supported, including multiple memory regions, moveable regions, per-line
tab stops, alternate cursor, the Ann Arbor keyboard with 64 separate
shift states per key, host-customizable printer controls, forms, etc.

<dt><b>ANSI-BBS <a href="#ansi">(*)</a></b>

</dl> 

<h2><a name="restrictions"><hr>Restrictions on Terminal Emulations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Only 16 colors are supported.
<li>Local editing is not currently supported.
<li>Multiple pages are not supported.
<li>AIXTERM and HPTERM emulations are not X servers; they are terminal types
that support the same escape and key sequences as the X-based terminal windows
on AIX and HP-UX, respectively.
<li>Due to Console-mode restrictions, the following features are not supported
    in K95.EXE, they're only available in the GUI version (K95G.EXE):
    <ul>
        <li>Dim characters - these are shown in bold instead
        <li>Underlining is simulated by coloration.
        <li>True double-width and double-height characters are simulated since
            they can't be shown in a Console window.
    </ul>
</li>

</ul>

<p>

The HP, Wyse, and Televideo emulations do not support the host-controlled
status line; function-key labels are supported but not displayed in the
status line. Function key labels can be displayed in a popup dialog using 
the \Kfnkeys keyboard verb which is normally assigned to Alt-F.

<p>

The names in the <a href="#ttlist">terminal type list</a>
are those used in the Terminal Type box on the Terminal
page of the Dialer entry notebook, and by the SET TERMINAL TYPE command.
These names are also sent to the host in Telnet terminal type negotiations
unless you have specified a TELNET terminal-type name to override it.

<h3><a name="ansi"><hr>ANSI Terminal Types</h3>

Whenever a (PC) <a href="gloss.html#g_ansi">ANSI</a> terminal type is chosen,
the following actions are executed automatically:

<p>

<ul>
<li>SET TERMINAL BYTESIZE 8
<li>SET PARITY NONE
<li>SET TERMINAL CHARACTER-SET TRANSPARENT
<li>SET TERMINAL COLOR TERMINAL LGRAY BLACK
<li>Your PC code page (right half) is designated to G1, G2, and G3.
</ul>

<p>

The normal mode of operation for any ANSI terminal type is to converse with
a host application that uses a PC code page as its character set, and whose
code page is the same as your code page.  This is because ANSI terminal
emulation is generally used for applications where there is a lot of line and
box drawing -- "graphics" simulated by colored character cells.

<p>

In some environments, however, the host sends Latin-1 or other codes for
accented or special characters.  In such cases, you can set your terminal
character set to Latin-1 (or other set) AFTER selecting an ANSI terminal type,
for example:

<p>
<pre>
  set terminal type scoansi                 ; Sets TRANSPARENT
  set terminal remote character-set latin1  ; Set it to Latin-1
</pre>
<p>

But Latin-1 (and Latin-2, Cyrillic, Hebrew, etc) do not include the many
box-drawing characters needed for ANSI emulation, and the simple form of the
<tt>SET TERMINAL CHARACTER-SET</tt> command shown above assigns Latin-1 to all
of G1, G2, and G3.  Thus you must also ensure that your PC code page remains
available as an alternate character set by using the more specific form of the
command, which is:

<p>
<pre>
  SET TERMINAL REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET <i>name [ </i>G<i>n ]</i>
</pre>
<p>

This lets you change your remote character set without having to respecify
(or even know) your local PC character set (or code page).  The optional
G<i>n</i> field designates the named set to the specified terminal graphics
table, G0, G1, G2, or G3 (you can specify more than one) according to
<a href="gloss.html#g_iso">ISO</a> 4873 and 2022 rules.

<p>

IMPORTANT: Please note that it is not possible to mix Latin-1 or other
ISO standard host character sets with line-and-box drawing without using
multiple character sets via ISO 2022 switching rules.

<p>

If you need to create <i>files</i> that contain a mixture of Roman letters,
non-Roman letters or accented Roman letters, and line-and/or-box-drawing
characters, you must use a nonstandard character set on the host that contains
all the characters you need, such as a PC code page, and then set K95's
remote character-set to that character set in order to view them.

<p>

Also note that terminals and PCs provide no way to <i>type</i> line- and
box-drawing characters.  Thus if you need to create files that contain them
from the keyboard, you must use the SET KEY command to assign their values to
the keys of your choice.  (The Alt-digit-digit-digit technique can not be used
in K95; see BUGS.TXT item 132.)

<h3><a name="hpterm"><hr>HPTERM Emulation</h3>

This is a functional HPTERM (Hewlett Packard Xterm) emulation, but lacking
color and multiple pages.  When function keys are programmed and/or labeled,
you can view the labels on a popup help screen using the new \Kfnkeys verb,
which is assigned by default to Alt-f.

<p>

When the HPTERM emulation is selected, character sets are assigned as follows:

<p>
<pre>
   Remote: GL->G0: US ASCII (94 chars)
           GR->G1: Hewlett Packard Roman 8 (96 chars)
               G2: HP Line Drawing Graphics (96 chars)
               G3: HP Line Drawing Graphics (96 chars)
</pre>

<h3><a name="97801"><hr>SNI-97801 Emulation</h3>
The SNI-97801 is an advanced terminal designed specificly with the multiple
language market in mind.  Kermit 95 does not support the following features 
of the terminal:

<p>

<ul>
<li>downloadable soft character sets
<li>downloadable compose key settings
</ul>

<p>

The SNI-97801 has a keyboard with more than 42 function and editing keys which
cannot be mapped directly to a PC keyboard.  K95 provides 
<a href="kverbs.html">keyboard verbs</a> for all of the SNI-97801 keys although 
most are not assigned to the PC keyboard due to lack of space.

<p>

Kermit 95 does support all of the 7-bit and 8-bit CH.CODE modes which are controlled
by the following commands:

<p>

<ul>
<li>SET TERMINAL SNI-CH.CODE {ON, OFF} or the \Ksni_ch_code keyboard verb
<li>SET TERMINAL BYTESIZE { 7, 8 }
</ul>

<p>

The CH.CODE mode determines whether the terminal communicates using International
character sets such U.S. ASCII and ISO Latin 1; or whether it uses a National 
character set such as German.  The SET TERMINAL LANGUAGE command is used
to specify the default language.  

<p>

The Firmware Versions numbers can be customized using the SET TERMINAL 
SNI-FIRWARE-VERSIONS <keyboard> <terminal> command.  The default keyboard 
version number is 920031 and the default terminal version number is 830851.

<h3><a name="switch"><hr>Automatic Actions on Switching Terminal Types</h3>

Terminal types can be switched by user command ("set terminal type"), hot key
(<tt>\Ktermtype</tt>, normally assigned to Alt-t), Telnet negotiations, or (in
some cases) by host escape sequence.  Whenever the terminal type is set or
switched:

<p>
<ul>
<li>The screen is cleared.

<p>

<li>The corresponding terminal-specific keymap is activated.

<p>

<li>A macro named <tt>TT_<i>XXX</i></tt>, where <tt><i>xxx</i></tt> is the
same as the terminal type name, is executed if such a macro is defined;
e.g. tt_vt320, tt_scoansi, etc.  Such a macro definition might include
<tt>SET</tt> <tt>TERM</tt> <tt>HEIGHT</tt> or <tt>WIDTH</tt> commands.
</ul>

<h3><a name="senddata"><hr>Terminal Send Data modes</h3>

Many terminals including the Wyse and Televideo terminals support a SEND DATA
feature which allows the host application to query the terminal and request
that a copy of all of the data on the screen be sent to the host.  This
feature is very useful with applications that process a complete form of data
at a time; or that allow a single terminal to be used with multiple sessions.
However, this feature is also a security hole which can be exploited to steal
data.  Therefore, Kermit 95 disables the SEND DATA feature by default.  If you
need to use SEND DATA with your application, you must add a SET TERMINAL
SEND-DATA ON command to your K95CUSTOM.INI (K2CUSTOM.INI for OS/2) file.
