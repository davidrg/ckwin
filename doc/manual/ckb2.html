Since its modest beginnings in 1985, C-Kermit has grown into a powerful and
complex communications and scripting program, the most portable of all
communication software programs, running in its most common form on all types
of UNIX systems and derivatives -- hundreds of them -- from desktop PCs to
mammoth supercomputers; on Digital's OpenVMS operating system across the
entire VAX and Alpha lines.  In the mass market, C-Kermit also forms the basis
for the new shrink-wrapped Kermit software products for Microsoft Windows 95
and NT.  Versions of C-Kermit are also available for
such diverse platforms as the Apple Macintosh, the Commodore Amiga, Bell Labs
Plan 9, Stratus
VOS fault-tolerant systems, Data General AOS/VS, and Microware's OS-9 realtime
operating system for PCs, as well as the new BeBox.
<p>
C-Kermit is a full-function communications software program for serial-port
connections (modem or direct) and also for network connections via TCP/IP,
X.25, and other networking methods.  It offers automatic dialing, terminal
connection (and in the Windows and OS/2 versions, emulation of many types of
terminals), fast and robust error-free file transfer, a vast array of
national and international character-set translations, and a powerful
scripting language for automation of all communications-related tasks.
<p>
The first release of C-Kermit in its present form was 5A(188), in 1992,
accompanied by the first edition of <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>.  Like the
other books in the Kermit series, <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite> has been a
long-lasting best seller by
computer-book standards in its original English edition as well as in German
translation as "C-Kermit - Einf&uuml;hrung und Referenz" from Verlag Heinz
Heise in Hannover.
<p>
In the intervening years, C-Kermit has gone through a series of incremental
changes, adding capability after capability.  Now, four years later, it has
evolved to such a degree as to seem like a completely different program.
Furthermore, its role has changed.  Increasingly, it is the communications and
scripting "engine" behind the menu, the automated system, the graphical user
interface.
<p>
The new second edition of <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite> serves as the universal
technical reference on C-Kermit as it applies to all the platforms it runs on.
Like the first edition, it covers data communications in general, and all of
the specific capabilities of C-Kermit in particular.  Unlike most other
computer manuals, but like the first edition, it takes pride in explaining
things to give readers a good understanding of the tremendously complicated
world of data communications and networking, particularly in the international
arena.  This is why Kermit books, unlike practically any other software
manuals, are also used as textbooks in university and professional development
courses.
<p>
The new edition includes a revised and updated tutorial on data
communications, with new emphasis on today's high-speed modems and how to make
the best use of them, and it covers all the features added to C-Kermit
since version 5A(188).  Some of the more noteworthy ones include:
<ul>
<li>The most sophisticated and flexible handling of modems, telephone numbers,
dialing directories, and dialing available anywhere, automatically
handling PBX, local, long-distance, toll-free, and international calling,
with automatic redialing, etc, as well as a new ability to accept incoming
calls.  Plus all sorts of new features for dialing with credit cards,
<a href="pagers.html">pagers</a>, and so on.  Plus:

<li>New techniques for achieving faster and faster file transfers, and a
detailed analysis of file transfer performance.

<li>A new method for recovering failed file transfers from the point of
failure.

<li>Built-in support for external protocols such as XMODEM, YMODEM, and ZMODEM.

<li>New security features.

<li>Automatic file-transfer initiation.

<li>Advanced client/server features.

<li>Support for many new platforms -- most notably Windows 95 and NT,
and Stratus VOS.

<li>Support for many new character sets, including Hebrew.

<li>Massive improvements in the power and usability of the script language,
the mere itemizing of which would take a small book itself.
</ul>

Like the first edition, the new edition will include complete reference
material: lengthy appendices for UNIX and VMS particulars,
character-set tables, an "acronym decoder", a profuse bibliography,
and a thorough and well-designed index.
<p>
As the world becomes increasingly hooked-up, wired, and online, sophisticated
tools like C-Kermit will be increasingly in demand -- by systems integrators,
network managers, Internet service providers, makers of turnkey systems of all
kinds, government contractors, and workers in every field where automated
communication must take place.  At the same time, C-Kermit will be in the
hands of ever-increasing numbers of end-users, primarily in its shrink-wrapped
form as Kermit 95 for Windows 95, Windows NT, and OS/2.  <cite>Using
C-Kermit</cite> is, of course, included in the Kermit 95 package, and even the
most "naive" users find themselves turning to it because it is so packed with
information, and at the same time so accessible and easy to use.
