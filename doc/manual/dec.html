Note: All the third-party products discussed here have been discontinued
  and are no longer commercially available. None of them are compatible with
  any version of Windows newer than Windows Server 2003.

<p>Due to unclear licensing, support for SuperLAT and TES32 is no longer
  included by default as of Kermit 95 version 3.0. Support <em>may</em> return
  in a future release, but in the meantime you can compile Kermit 95 from
  source yourself if you need it.

This section applies to Windows 95 and NT only; the OS/2 version
does not support SuperLAT, but it does support PATHWORKS via SET NETWORK 
TYPE DECNET (see <a href="os2k95.html">OS/2 Specifics of Kermit 95</a>
  <!--6.4.2 and OS2K95.TXT  <=== What was 6.4.2??    -->).
<p>
SuperLAT(TM) was a commercial product from Meridian Technology Corporation,
formerly at 11 McBride Corporate Center Drive, Suite 250,
Chesterfield MO 63005-1407 USA:

Meridian Technology discontinued all sales and support for SuperLAT on 31
December 2000 and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.os.vms/c/bdib6QcRZqo/m/uKLGZCsBc9IJ">
offered source code</a> to customers with the required LAT patent licenses for
self-support purposes.

<p>SuperLAT provides LAT (Local Area Transport) service to Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC) VMS or other hosts that support it, as well as to LAT-based
DECservers, e.g. for shared dialout modem access.  You can make SuperLAT
connections from Kermit 95 if you have SuperLAT installed on your Windows 95
or NT system.  The method is as follows:
<p><pre>
  SET NETWORK TYPE SUPERLAT
  SET HOST <i>service-name [ password ]</i>
</pre><p>
where <i>service-name</i> is normally the DECnet host (node) name of the
system you are connecting to.  It can also be a node/port combination (no
spaces), with a (forward) slash (no spaces) separating the node and port
designations, for example to access a specific modem port on a DECserver.  If
the service is password-protected, you must also include a password after the
service-name or node/port.  Examples:
<p><pre>
  SET HOST OOFAVAX         ; Service name
  SET HOST OOFAVAX SECRET  ; Service name with password
  SET HOST LATBOX/3        ; Serial Port 3 on LATBOX
  SET HOST LATBOX/3 SECRET ; Serial Port 3 on LATBOX with password
</pre><p>
WARNING: Uploading files on a LAT connection is problematic due to intrinsic
limitations of LAT buffering.  Using 90-byte packets and 1 window slot seems
to work in most cases (tell VMS C-Kermit to "set receive packet-length 90");
greater lengths tend to hang the VMS session.  Downloads can use any packet
length or window size.  WARNING: Do NOT tell VMS or VMS C-Kermit to disable
flow control.  VMS C-Kermit MUST have "set flow xon/xoff".

<h3><a name="decpath">DECnet / PATHWORKS</h3>

<b>Links:</b> [<a href="#dectes">Next</a>] [<a href="#decslat">Prev</a>] [<a href="#dec">Index</a>]
<p>

This section applies to 32bit Windows 95, NT, 2000, XP, Server 2003, and OS/2
on x86 and Alpha CPUs only.
<p>
PATHWORKS is a networking package for PCs formerly available from Digital
Equipment Corporation, later Compaq and then HP.  It was also
once known as DECNET/DOS.  Kermit has supported this networking method in OS/2
since the mid 90s; as of version 1.1.13 (June 1997), K95 supports it in
Windows 95 and NT too. In Windows 95 and NT, Digital PATHWORKS-32 V7.0 or later
is required. In OS/2, PATHWORKS 2.0 or higher can be used. The final release
of PATHWORKS-32 for Windows was version 7.4 released in 2004.
<p>
If you have PATHWORKS installed on your PC, you can use "set network type
pathworks" and then "set host xxx", where xxx is a DECnet node name or
address.
<p>
WARNING: When you give a SET HOST command, it can not be interrupted.  If the
host is not available, it might take a long time for PATHWORKS to time out and
return control to K95.
<p>
In your SET NETWORK TYPE PATHWORKS command, you can specify whether to make a
LAT (local area) or CTERM (wide area) connection:
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>SET NETWORK TYPE { PATHWORKS, DECNET } [ { CTERM, LAT } ]</tt>
<dd>Choose PATHWORKS as the network type.  DECNET is a synonym for PATHWORKS.
If you don't specify a protocol, LAT is used.  CTERM is not available in
Kermit/2.
</dl>
<p>
So a complete sequence might be:
<p><pre>
  SET NETWORK TYPE PATHWORKS LAT   ; Choose PATHWORKS networking
  SET HOST CHEMVAX                 ; Make a connection to node CHEMVAX
  CONNECT                          ; Enter the terminal window
</pre><p>
If you know you have some form of LAT installed on your PC, but you don't know
which one:
<p><pre>
  SET NETWORK TYPE SUPERLAT
  IF FAIL SET NETWORK TYPE PATHWORKS LAT
  IF FAIL END 1 Sorry - No LAT installed here.
  SET HOST ...
</pre>

<h3><a name="dectes">TES32</h3>

<b>Links:</b> [<a href="#decpath">Prev</a>] [<a href="#dec">Index</a>]
<p>

This section applies to Windows 95/98/ME only.  The OS/2 version
of C-Kermit does not support TES32, and TES32 is not available for Windows NT,
  Windows 2000 or newer.
<p>
The TES networking method (virtual terminal service to VMS hosts over Novell
networks) is supported as of version 1.1.8 (November 1996) via
SET NETWORK TYPE TES32, if you have the TES32 product, and the corresponding
server on your VMS host. These were products of InterConnections Inc / Emulex
and were discontinued sometime at the end of the 90s.  More info at:
<p><pre>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011007023412/http://www.emulex.com/leverage/index.html">http://www.emulex.com/leverage/index.html</a> (via archive.org)
</pre><p>
In fact, TES connections were also supported prior to this version 1.1.8, since
TES is accessed through the same interface as SuperLAT. TES32 is not mentioned in
the various Dialer dialog boxes; just choose SuperLAT wherever you need to use
TES32.
