<h2>Kermit 95 Fonts</h2>

Console applications such as Kermit 95 are not allowed to know anything about
the window they are running in, nor to have any control over the font.  Thus
there are no commands or dialog boxes with which K-95 can change the font
itself, or save your preferred font size  (this will change in the forthcoming
<a href="gloss.htm#g_gui">GUI</a> K-95 version).  In the meantime, you
can use the following techniques.
<p>
<b>Contents:</b>
<ul>
<li><a><a href="#font95">Windows 95/98</a>
<li><a><a href="#fontn5">Windows NT/2000</a>
<li><a><a href="#fontos2">OS/2</a>
</ul>

<h3><a name="font95"><hr>Windows 95, 98, and ME</h3>

The installation procedure makes a "K95" icon for you in your Kermit 95
directory.  Open a graphical view of the Kermit 95 program directory and:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the K95 icon.
<li>Choose "Create shortcut".  A shortcut icon is created.
<li>Drag the shortcut icon to wherever you want it.
<li>Right-click on the shortcut icon.
<li>Choose Properties.
<li>Click on the Font tab.
<li>Pick the font you want.  <i>Do not choose "Auto".</i>
<li>While you're at it, go to Misc tab and uncheck QuickEdit and Fast Pasting
(see Bug List items <a href="k95bugs.htm#b61">61</a> and
<a href="k95bugs.htm#b223">223</a>.
<li>Make any other changes you want.
<li>Click OK.
</ol>
<p>

Now whenever you start K95 from this icon, it should come up with the font
you have chosen.  To change the default values that Windows 95/98 uses when
creating console windows:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Open the folder <tt>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM</tt>
<li>Right click on <tt>CONAGENT.EXE</tt>
<li>Choose Properties
<li>Click on the Font tab
<li>Pick the font you want.  
<li>Go to Misc tab and uncheck QuickEdit and Fast Pasting.
<li>Make any other changes you want.
<li>Click OK.
</ol>

Note that the font sizes are determined by Windows 95 and can not be changed
via a dialog box.  The True Type font that is used may be changed by editing
the Registry (not recommended).


<h3><a name="fontn5"><hr>Windows NT, 2000, and XP</h3>

The fonts used in the NT Console Window may be changed by editing the "Font"
page in the Properties notebook which is accesible from the System Menu.
The Font page lets you choose between lists of installed 
True Type fonts and Code-Page specific <i>Raster Fonts</i>.  In addition
to the Font name the size may also be specified.  Once saved the changes
are remembered for future instances of the application.  

<p>

Windows NT ships with the Lucida Console font which contains the
characters for Western and Eastern European languages as well as Greek 
and Cyrillic.  Lucida Console does not contain the Euro character
nor does it contain the characters for Hebrew and many other languages
supported by Kermit 95.

<p>

Newer versions of Windows might ship with Courier New, which has about twice
as many characters as Lucida Console, and includes Hebrew and Arabic.

<h3><a name="fontos2"><hr>OS/2</h3>

The fonts used in the OS/2 Console Window may be changed by choosing "Font
Size ..." from the System Menu.  The "Change" button changes the font size
for the current window only, whereas the "Save" button will change the font
size for all future windows of this application.
