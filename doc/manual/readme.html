<h3><hr><a name="x1">1. WHAT'S WHAT</a></h3>

Kermit 95 Version 3.0.0, the twenty-fifth update since the
original release in September 1995, is currently in development with periodic
beta releases to fix issues, restore missing functionality and add new
features now expected of modern terminal emulators. This is currently release:
<!--$ver-full$-->3.0.0 DEV<!--/$ver-full$-->

<p>Some features are still missing from the current beta release - it is
hoped that most of them, where possible, will return before the final stable
3.0 release.
</p>

<h3><hr><a name="x2">2. WHAT'S NEW</a></h3>

Kermit 95 3.0 is the first open source release of K95. Differences from the
last commercial release, 2.1.3, include:

<p>
<ul>

<li>Improved compatibility and appearance on modern Windows versions including
  large file support and ports to 64bit Windows on: x86-64, ARM64 and Itanium
<li>Support for Windows NT on Alpha and PowerPC has been restored
<li>New ports to 32bit Windows on: MIPS and ARM32, and new support for Windows NT 3.50</li>
<li>PTYs are now supported on Windows 10 v1809 and newer</li>
<li>Mouse Wheel support</li>
<li>Terminal Mouse Reporting</li>
<li>REXX is now supported on x86 and x86-64 Windows XP and newer as well as OS/2</li>
<li>Named Pipe connections are now supported on Windows as well as OS/2</li>
<li>New modern SSH implementation based on libssh</li>
<li>Support for the latest versions of OpenSSL and MIT Kerberos for Windows</li>
<li>TLS SNI support in the http and telnet clients</li>
<li>A number of new escape sequences are supported in the ANSI terminal
  emulator to improve xterm and linux compatibility</li>
<li>The screen update interval is no longer fixed at 100ms in K95G - it can be
  changed with <tt>set terminal screen-update fast</tt></li>
<li>New ADM5 terminal type</li>
<li>New SKERMIT command</li>
<li>Updated to C-Kermit 10</li>
</ul>
<p>

Unfortunately some features have had to be removed from v3.0 due to changing
  3rd party dependencies and licensing concerns:

<p>
<ul>
  <li>SSHv1 and some Kerberos-related SSH commands and options are no longer
    supported as the new SSH backend (libssh) doesn't support them</li>
  <li>SSH and SSL/TLS are no longer supported on Windows versions older than XP
    as OpenSSL and libssh no longer support these platforms.</li>
  <li>SSL/TLS is no longer supported on IBM OS/2 as the compiler now used,
    Open Watcom, is not compatible with OpenSSL</li>
  <li>SRP and Kerberos IV support is no longer included as these 3rd-party
    libraries have been unmaintained for some years now.
  </li>
  <li>SuperLAT and TES32 support is no longer included by default due to unclear
    header licensing. This may change in the future.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>As Kermit 95 is open-source now, if you <em>need</em> support for SRP,
  Kerberos IV, SuperLAT or TES32 it is still possible to compile Kermit 95 with
  these features by using an older compiler and supplying the now unmaintained
  3rd-party libraries required to support them. Instructions for doing so are
  included with the source code.

<p>For a full list of everything that's changed since Kermit 95 2.1.3, consult
  the change log that you should have received with your copy of Kermit 95.

[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
[ <a href="index.html">K95 Manual</a> ]

<h3><hr><a name="x3">3. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</a></h3>

All you need to use Kermit 95 are:

<ul>

<li>Any 32bit or 64bit Windows compatible computer running any 32bit or 64bit
  version of Windows except for Windows NT 3.1 or MIPS Windows NT 3.50, or a
  PC running IBM OS/2 2.0 or later.
</li>

<!--<li>An Intel-based or compatible PC running Microsoft Windows 95, 98, ME, NT-->
<!--4.0 or later, Windows 2000, or Windows XP, or IBM OS/2 3.0 or later.-->

<li>The normal amount of memory and swap space for those platforms
(as with any Windows application, K95 works best when there is plenty
of memory and a fast processor).

<li>For making connections: A serial port and/or modem, and/or a network
connection.

</ul>



<p>

The following are not supported:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Windows NT 3.10</li>
<li>MIPS Windows NT 3.50</li>
<li>Alpha Windows NT 3.50 is console-mode only (no K95G)</li>
<li>Win32s (Win32 on Windows 3.1x) due to lack of support for threading</li>
<li>Windows CE and Pocket PC are not supported.
</ul>

<p>
<!-- TODO: update memory and disk requirements -->
Windows 95/98/ME and Windows NT/2000/XP are demand-paged virtual memory
operating systems, and so the time-honored question, "How much RAM is
required?" does not strictly apply to Kermit 95.  But as with most Windows
applications: the more the better.  K95 together with all the DLLs it might
use (which in turns depend on which features you elected during installation
or invoke at runtime) needs between 5 and 30MB, most of which is (a) shared
among multiple copies of K95 and other applications, and (b) usually paged out
to disk.  Thus the incremental cost of running two, three, four, or more
copies of K95 is small.

<p>

Kermit 95's total disk footprint after installation is about 32MB.
  Approximately one additional megabyte is needed when
the Dialer is active, for backup and temporary files, depending on the size of
your Dialer database.

<h3><hr><a name="x4">4. SECURITY AND ENCRYPTION</a></h3>

Kermit 95 contains strong cryptography and its legality may vary from country
to country. You may find the information at
<a href="http://www.cryptolaw.org/">cryptolaw.org</a> useful but the Kermit
Project can not vouch for its correctness.

<p>

See the Kermit 95 Online Manual's <a href="security.html">Network Security
Methods Reference</a> for further information on Authentication and Encryption
methods supported by Kermit 95.

<h3><hr><a name="x5">5. INSTALLING KERMIT 95</a></h3>

Current releases of Kermit 95 do not yet have an installation procedure.
Beta releases are currently distributed as &quot;portable&quot; applications -
just unzip the release to somewhere convenient and create a shortcut or
run k95g.exe. Kermit 95 isn't specifically designed as a portable application
however, and it <em>will</em> create a few registry keys under
<tt>\HKCU\Software\Kermit</tt> on first run.

<p>If you would like to have shortcuts and file associations created, the old
  K95 Registry Tool is included with current K95 3.0 betas so you can create
  these by running k95regtl.exe and choosing which things to create.

<p>
  There are no particular procedures <em>required</em> when upgrading from
  Kermit 95 v2.1.3 but due to changes in the dialer it is advised you
  take a backup of your dialer data files if you use the dialer. Otherwise, you
  should be able to run K95 2.1.3 and 3.0 side-by-side.
</p>

<h3><hr><a name="x6">6. UNINSTALLING KERMIT 95</a></h3>

For the current release uninstalling is the reverse of installing. If you used
the K95 Registry Tool (k95regtl.exe) to setup associations, etc, run it again
to undo those things, then delete the K95 files you originally extracted from
the release archive along with any shortcuts you created.

<p>One other bit of cleanup you may want to do: K95 creates a few of registry
  keys under <tt>\HKCU\Software\Kermit</tt> which can be deleted if you wish.
</p>

<!--
Should you wish to remove Kermit 95 from your Windows 95 system, it depends on
how you installed it in the first place.  In both cases you should exit from
all Kermit programs (K95, the Dialer) first.  Then:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><i>If you installed K95 with the text-mode installer</i>
(<tt>SETUP.EXE</tt>):
<dd>
<ol>
<li>If you used K95 Registry Tool to add Kermit 95 configuration information
into the Windows Registry, run it again to remove the information from the
Registry.
<li>Drag the Kermit 95 folder to the Recycle Bin.  Do the same with any
shortcuts you might have created to Kermit 95.
</ol>

<p>

<dt><i>If you installed K95 with the GUI InstallShield installer:</i>
<dd>Simply use
Add/Remove Programs in the Windows Control Panel to remove it:
<ol>
<li>Press the Change/Remove button to re-start the installer.

<li>Select Remove all installed components

<li>The uninstall process deliberately leaves behind certain files
associated with Kermit 95, in case you ever re-install K95 and want your
customizations intact, or you want to keep files that you downloaded, etc:
<ul>
<li><tt>IKSD.KSC</tt>
<li><tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt>
<li><tt>DIALUSR.DAT</tt>
<li><tt>KRB.CON</tt>
<li><tt>KRBREALM.CON</tt>
<li><tt>KRB5.INI</tt>
<li>Each user's <a href="#files">application data directory</a>
and subdirectories.
<li>Each user's <tt>DOWNLOAD</tt> directory.
<li>Any files the K95 Installer didn't install.
</ul>
If you wish to remove these files you may do so after the uninstall is
complete by deleting the files in the Windows Explorer.

<li>If you have installed Kerberos the uninstall might require a reboot
to remove the <tt>krbcc32s.exe</tt> application that stores your
Kerberos credentials in memory.
</ol>

<h3><hr><a name="x7">7. REGISTRATION</a></h3>

Registration of Kermit 95 v3.0 and newer is no longer required - starting with
this release it is completely free and open source.

<p>This does not apply to Kermit 95 v2.1.3 and earlier releases -
those are <em>not</em> free. Columbia may still sell bulk licenses for K95
v2.1.3 if you need an older version for some reason.

<h3><a name="files"><a name="directories"><a name="x9"><hr>9. FILES AND DIRECTORIES</a></a></a></h3>

<b><u>NOTE: Section 9 (and 9.1/9.2/9.3) has not been updated for K95 v3.0 yet!</u></b>
  The plan is for K95 v3.0 to largely match what is described here when it's
  installed via an installer, but installers haven't been built yet. If you've
  upgraded from K95 v2.1.3 then your setup will end up looking like that
  described in section 9.2 as the current distribution method of K95 v3.0 betas
  is more similar to that of K95 v1.1.20 and earlier.


<pre>
  9.1. <a href="#x9.1"><b>The New Directory Structure</b></a>
  9.2. <a href="#x9.2"><b>Patches and Search Order</b></a>
  9.3. <a href="#x9.3"><b>Important K95 Files</b></a>
</pre>
<p>

Version 1.1.21 of Kermit 95 marks a dramatic departure from earlier versions
in file and directory structure.  1.1.20 and earlier stored everything in a
single directory tree, such as <tt>C:\K95</tt>.  This was simple to explain,
short to type, kept everything together in one place, and made your Kermit
files easy to find; for example, when you wanted to 
<a href="#x10.3">edit your <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> file</a>.  However, the
original scheme does mesh with multiuser file systems like the ones on Windows
XP or Terminal Server.  Not only does it prevent users from having their own
separate customization files, dialing directories, download areas, and so on,
it also prevents system administrators from being able to enforce appropriate
file access permissions on the program tree.

<p>

The new directory structure makes server installation much more natural.  The
Program files directory goes on the server, read-only.  The Global (All Users)
K95 data directory goes on the server too, with any desired site-specific
customizations, and then made read-only too.  Then the user-specific K95 data
tree goes with the user's other data files in the user's Application Data
tree, read/write.

<h3><a name="x9.1"><hr>9.1. The New Directory Structure</a></h3>

As of version 1.1.21, Kermit 95 is installed just like any other Windows
application.  Parts of it go into "Program Files", other parts into the All
Users data area, and still others into the user's directory tree.  This is the
Windows Way of installing applications.  The Windows directory paths are long
and contain spaces, which tends to confuse text-based programs -- not just
Kermit 95, but any program that has commands composed of fields
separated by spaces.  For this reason Kermit 95 represents these directories
by variables that expand into Windows "short names" such as
"<tt>MYDOCU~1</tt>" rather than long names like "My Documents".  Kermit
95's new directory structure is as follows:

<p>

To alleviate confusion, Kermit 95 1.1.21 has a new <tt>ORIENTATION</tt>
command that gives this information as it applies to your computer.  Here's
an example from Windows XP:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\Documents and Settings\Olga\] K-95&gt; <u>orient</u> 

  Program name:
    k95

  Your home directory:
    Variable:   \v(home)
    Long name:  C:/Documents and Settings/Olga/
    Short name: C:/DOCUME~1/OLGA/

  K95's current directory:
    Variable:   \v(directory)
    Long name:  C:/Documents and Settings/Olga/
    Short name: C:/DOCUME~1/OLGA/

  K95 Program directory:
    Variable:   \v(exedir)
    Long name:  C:/Program Files/Kermit 95/
    Short name: C:/PROGRAM~/KERMIT~/

  K95 Initialization file directory:
    Variable:   \v(inidir)
    Long name:  C:/Documents and Settings/All Users/Application Data/Kermit 95/
    Short name: C:/DOCUME~1/ALLUSE~1/APPLIC~1/KERMIT~1/

  Current directory when started:
    Variable:   \v(startup)
    Long name:  C:/tmp/
    Short name: C:/tmp/

  K95 data for all users:
    Variable:   \v(common)
    Long name:  C:/Documents and Settings/All Users/Application Data/Kermit 95/
    Short name: C:/DOCUME~1/ALLUSE~1/APPLIC~1/KERMIT~1/

  Your personal data directory tree:
    Variable:   \v(personal)
    Long name:  C:/Documents and Settings/Olga/My Documents/
    Short name: C:/DOCUME~1/OLGA/MYDOCU~1/

  Your deskop directory tree:
    Variable:   \v(desktop)
    Long name:  C:/Documents and Settings/Olga/Desktop/
    Short name: C:/DOCUME~1/OLGA/DESKTOP/

  Your personal K95 data tree:
    Variable:   \v(appdata)
    Long name:  C:/Documents and Settings/Olga/Application Data/Kermit 95/
    Short name: C:/DOCUME~1/OLGA/APPLIC~1/KERMIT~1/

  Your K95 download directory:
    Variable:   \v(download)
    Long name:
    Short name:
</pre>
<p>

For script writers, a pair of new functions has been added to convert between
Windows long and short names:

<p>
<dl>

<dt><tt>\flongpathname(<i>path</i>)</tt><dt>

<dd>Converts the given <i>path</i> (file or directory name) from whatever
format it's in (short or long) to long format, except in Windows 95 and NT,
which do not have this capability, and therefore simply return the
<i>path</i> as it was given.

<p>

<dt><tt>\fshortpathname(<i>path</i>)</tt><dt>

<dd>Converts the given <i>path</i> to short format.

</dl>
<p>

<tt>\flongpathname()</tt> (except in Windows 95 and NT) can be used in
conjunction with <tt>\fpathname()</tt>, which returns the full pathname of a
given file in short format, to show the full long path for a given file, e.g.:

<p>
<pre>
  K95&gt; <u>cd \v(exedir)</u>
  K95&gt; <u>echo \flongpathname(\fpathname(k95.exe))</u>
  C:\Program Files\Kermit 95\k95.exe
  K95&gt; 
</pre>

<h3><a name="x9.2"><hr>9.2. Patches and Search Order</a></h3>

<b>Those who patch</b> up to version 1.1.21 from earlier releases will have a
hybrid structure; the old structure remains as it was, but the new structure
is created upon first use of the new <tt>K95.EXE</tt> or Dialer.  This adds an
element of doubt as to where a particular file is or, if there are multiple
copies, which one is used?  The following rules apply:

<p>
<ul>

<li>The original directory structure is preserved and all your customized
files are left intact (<tt>K95[CUSTOM].INI</tt>, <tt>DIALUSR.DAT</tt>, etc)
in their original locations.

<p>

<li>Upon first use of the patched K95 or K95DIAL prorgram:

<ol>

<li>The <tt>\v(common)</tt> and <tt>\v(appdata)</tt> directories are created
automatically.  The <tt>\v(common)</tt> and <tt>\v(appdata)</tt> directories
are each populated with the following empty subdirectories: CERTS, CRLS,
KEYMAPS, PHONES, SCRIPTS, SSH, and (<tt>\v(appdata)</tt> only) TMP, some of
which (KEYMAPS, PHONES, SCRIPTS, and TMP) duplicate directories that already
exist in your <tt>\v(exedir)</tt> tree.  The CERTS, CRLS, and SSH directories
are new so there should be no confusion about them.

<li>The <tt>\v(personal)</tt> directory is created if it does not exist
(except in Windows 95 versions that do not support it) and a DOWNLOAD
subdirectory is created in it.

</ol>
<p>

<li>Kermit searches for its initialization file, <tt>K95.INI</tt>,
in the following order:
<ol>
<li>The global (All Users) Kermit 95 data directory: <tt>\v(common)</tt>.
<li>Program directory: <tt>\v(exedir)</tt>.
</ol>

<p>

<li>Your initialization file looks for the site-specific customization file,
<tt>K95SITE.INI</tt>, in its <tt>\v(common)</tt> (All Users) directory and, if
found, executes it.  Note: if <tt>K95SITE.INI</tt> exists, it should end with
a TAKE command for the user's customization file,
<tt>\v(appdata)K95CUSTOM.INI</tt>.  If <tt>K95SITE.INI</tt> is not found,
<tt>K95.INI</tt> searches for the user's customization file,
<tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt>, in the following order: <tt>\v(appdata)</tt>,
<tt>\v(inidir)</tt>, <tt>\v(exedir)</tt> and, if found, executes it.

<p>

<li>If the <tt>K95.INI</tt> file was <i>not</i> found, K95 searches for
the user's customization file anyway, and if found, executes it.

<p>

<li>After installing the 1.1.21 patch, your <tt>DIALUSR.DAT</tt> file,
which contains all the entries you have defined or changed, remains in
Kermit's program directory <tt>\v(exedir)</tt>.

<p>

<li>The Dialer searches for your <tt>DIALUSR.DAT</tt> file
in the following order:
<ol>
<li>User-specific Kermit 95 data directory: <tt>\v(appdata)</tt>.
<li>Global (All Users) Kermit 95 data directory: <tt>\v(common)</tt>.
<li>Program directory: <tt>\v(exedir)</tt>.
<li>If no <tt>DIALUSR.DAT</tt> file is found a new one is created in
your <tt>\v(appdata)</tt> directory.
</ol>
<p>

<li>Old (pre-patch) scripts remain in <tt>\v(exedir)SCRIPTS</tt>, but
post-patch Dialer-generated scripts go in <tt>\v(appdata)SCRIPTS</tt>.  When a
script is executed with Kermit's <tt>TAKE</tt> command, and a specific path is
not given, Kermit searches for the script first in the current directory, then
in the same order as the customization file: <tt>\v(appdata)</tt> first,
<tt>\v(exedir)</tt> last.  For safety and sanity, it is better to give a full
pathname for script files that are not in K95's current directory.

<p>

<li>Dialing and network directory files are not searched for; you must tell
Kermit exactly where they are; either in the Dialer entry or in the
<tt>K95SITE.INI</tt> or <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> file.

<p>

<li>Each user's SSH-related files generated by Kermit go into the user's
<tt>\v(appdata)SSH</tt> directory, which is also where Kermit looks for them.
Site-wide SSH files can be placed into <tt>\v(common)SSH</tt> by the system
administrator.

<p>

<li>Each user's SSL/TLS-related X.509 certificate files should go into
<tt>\v(appdata)CERTS</tt>, which is also where Kermit looks for them.
Similarly, X.509 Certificate Revocation Lists should go in
<tt>\v(appdata)CRLS</tt>.  Site-wide certificates and CRLs can be placed in
<tt>\v(common)CERTS</tt> and <tt>\v(common)CRLS</tt> by the system
administrator.

</ul>
<p>

If you patch up to version 1.1.21 from an earlier version, it is recommended
that you convert the old structure to the new one to <i>(a)</i> allow multiple
user arrangements, <i>(b)</i> reduce confusion arising from multiple copies of
files and directories, and <i>(c)</i> to prepare for an easy transition to K95
2.0.  Here's a table summarizing what should be moved where, which can be
done at your convenience.

Notes:

<ol>

<li>In entries that give "<tt>\v(common)</tt> or <tt>\v(appdata)</tt>" as
new location choices, pick the destination for each file according to
whether it's for all users or only for you.

<li>Host Mode should be considered obsolescent, replaceable by WIKSD, at
least in Windows NT, 2000, and XP.

HINT: Entire directories and directory trees can be moved with the MOVE
command in the Windows Command Prompt or CMD window, provided you have
shut down any applications that might be using any of the affected directories
or files.  Example:

<dl>

<dt><tt>SETUP.EXE</tt>

<dd>The Kermit 95 setup (installation) program.  This is the old text-based
one, which is being phased out in favor a GUI InstallShield procedure (Windows
only).  It is not yet clear at this writing whether version 1.1.21 will be
packaged for retail, or only downloadable as a patch; it depends on when 2.0
is released.  If it is packaged for retail, it will have the GUI installation
rather than the text one (except if OS/2).

<dt><tt>K95DIAL.EXE</tt>

<dd>The Kermit 95 Dialer.  This is the GUI program that gives you
point-and-click access to all your connections.  It is normally found in the 
Program Files Kermit 95 directory.    Depending on your selections
at install time, you might have a desktop icon and/or Start menu entry for
this, as well as for <tt>K95.EXE</tt> (next item).  Location: Program
Directory.

<dt><tt>K95.EXE</tt>

<dd>The Kermit 95 program.  You can run this directly to bypass the Dialer
(normally only Kermit veterans would do this).  In version 1.1.21 and earlier,
this is the console version of K95.

<dt><tt>K95G.EXE</tt>

<dd>The GUI version of the Kermit 95 program (<i>for future reference</i>).

<dt><tt>K95.EXE</tt>

<dd>The Console version of the Kermit 95 program.

<dt><tt>K95D.EXE</tt>

<dd>An Internet Listener for incoming Host Mode connections.

<dt><tt>K95D.CFG</tt>

<dd>The configuration file for <tt>K95D.EXE</tt>.

<dt><tt>DIALER.DAT</tt>

<dd>Dialer screen definitions.  Note: All <tt>*.DAT</tt> and
<tt>*.ZNC</tt> files, as well as <tt>*.BK<i>n</i></tt> files, are associated
with the Dialer.

<dt><tt>TELNET.EXE</tt>

<dd>A "stub" that lets you use Kermit 95 as though its name and command-line
personality were those of Telnet.

<dt><tt>RLOGIN.EXE</tt>

<dd>A "stub" that lets you use Kermit 95 as though its name and command-line
personality were those of Rlogin.

<dt><tt>SSH-AGENT.EXE</tt>

<dd>The SSH Agent program (explained in the
<a href="sshclien.html">SSH Client</a> documentation.

<dt><tt>HOSTMODE.BAT</tt>

<dd>Run this to start the host-mode management program.

<dt><tt>DOCS</tt>
<dd>Supplemental documentation on various topics.

<dt><tt>DOCS\MANUAL</tt>

<dd>(under the Kermit 95 Program directory) The <a href="index.html">Kermit

<h3><a name="x9.3.2"><hr><i>9.3.2. In the All Users Kermit 95 Directory</i></a></h3>

In multiuser Windows installation, this directory should be writeable only
by the system administrator.

<dl>

<dt><tt>K95.INI</tt>

<dd>Initialization file for <tt>K95.EXE</tt>, normally found in the All Users
directory for Kermit 95, but in patched versions is likely to be in the
Program Directory.  Contains commands that are to be executed every time
<tt>K95.EXE</tt> is started.  See <a href="uck2epdf.html">
<cite>Using C-Kermit</cite></a> for more about
initialization files.  In Kermit 95, however, most of the traditional
functions of initialization files are taken over by the Dialer.  In any case,
you should not change or delete this file; all customizations should be made
in:

<dt><tt>K95SITE.INI</tt>

<dd>Site-specific customizations.  If this file exists, it is executed by 
the standard <tt>K95.INI</tt> file and, in turn, it executes the user's
customization file, <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt>.  If this file does not exist,
the user's customization file is executed directly.  As shipped, Kermit 95
includes a skeleton version of this file that simply prints a message
and executes the user's customization file.

<dt><tt>CA_CERTS.PEM</tt>

<dd>Site-wide OpenSSL X.509 Certificate Authority certificates.

<dt><tt>DIALINF.DAT</tt>

<dd>The Kermit 95 Dialer preloaded database (read-only).

<dt><tt>DIALORG.DAT</tt>

<dd>This file is not shipped from the factory.  If you wish to have
organization/site-wide Dialer entries, they can be created by adding new
entries to the Dialer and then renaming the resulting <tt>DIALUSR.DAT</tt>
file to <tt>DIALORG.DAT</tt>, from which point it is read-only.

</dl>	
<p>

The All Users K95 directory also contains the subdirectories listed in
the previous section.  Of particular interest are:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>PHONES</tt>
<dd>Dialing and network directories for use by everybody at the site.
<dt><tt>SCRIPTS</tt>
<dd>Kermit scripts for use by everybody at the site.
<dt><tt>PRINTER</tt>
<dd>Printer-related utilities, e.g. shell scripts for Unix to send Unix
files to your PC printer via K95's Pass-Through Printing feature.
<dt><tt>KEYMAPS</tt>
<dd>Sample and default key maps for reference and/or copying and modification
to suit your needs and preferences.
</dl>

Files in the <tt>KEYMAPS</tt> directory include:

<dl>
<dt><tt>CTRL2CAP.*</tt>
<dd>A utility for Win9x/ME for swapping the Ctrl and Caps Lock keys,
and optionally the Esc and <tt>`/~</tt> keys.
<dt><tt>KEYCODES.TXT</tt>
<dd>A reference listing of K95 and MS-DOS Kermit keycodes (plain text, wide).

<dt><tt>DEFAULT.KSC</tt>
<dd>A listing of K95's default Key mappings for each of its terminal types.
<dt><tt>EMACS.KSC</tt>
<dd>A sample key map for use with the EMACS fullscreen text editor on the host.
<dt><tt>SNI.KSC</tt>

<h3><i><a name="x9.3.3"><hr>9.3.3. In Each User's My Documents Directory</a></i></h3>

This directory is for keeping data files that are not necessarily associated
with a particular application.  This is where K95's DOWNLOAD directory goes,
since the files you download with Kermit might be for any application at all.
For this reason, your My Documents directory can also contain other material,
unrelated to K95.

<p>

In Windows 95, the user's My Documents directory does not necessarily exist,
since it is not part of the standard Windows 95 directory layout (it was first
added in Windows 98).  But it still might have been created by a Microsoft
Office component, Internet Explorer, or some other Microsoft application.  If
it does exist, and it does not already have a DOWNLOAD subdirectory, K95
installation creates one.  If it does not exist, no DOWNLOAD directory is
created.

<p>

Note that the <tt>\v(download)</tt> variable does not necessarily denote
Kermit's download directory.  Initially, this variable has no value.  It takes
on a value only when you have designated a download directory, either on the
General page of a Dialer entry, or with Kermit's SET FILE DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY
command.  The <tt>\v(personal)DOWNLOAD</tt> directory is an obvious choice,
but you can designate any directory you like for this purpose, or none at all,
in which case downloaded files go into K95's <i>current</i> directory, in the
absence of explicit instructions to the contrary.

<p>

If you want K95 to save downloaded files in its current directory by default,
leave its out-of-the-box configuration alone.  If you want it to save all
downloaded files in one specific directory by default, then do this in the
Dialer, or edit your <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> file (next section) to
include a SET FILE DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY command.

<h3><i><a name="x9.3.4"><hr>9.3.4. In Each User's K95 Application Data Directory</a></i></h3>

In multiuser Windows installation, each Kermit 95 user automatically gets
her/his own K95 application data directory upon first use of K95 1.1.21 or
later.  This directory tree allows full read/write access to its owner.

<dl>

<dt><tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt>

<dd>Customization file for <tt>K95.EXE</tt>, normally found in the
user-specific data directory for Kermit 95 (<tt>\v(appdata)</tt>), or in
patched versions in the Program Directory (<tt>\v(exedir)</tt>).  On multiuser
file systems, each user should have her/his own copy of this file.  You may
edit your copy to change your customizations, add new ones, define macros,
special keys, and so on.  In newly installed copies of K95 1.1.21, a sample
copy of this file is copied from the <tt>\v(common)</tt> directory to the
user's <tt>\v(appdata)</tt> directory the first time the user starts K95.  The
customization file is never modifed by Patch or InstallShield.

<p>

<dt><tt>DIALUSR.DAT</tt>

<dd>Your personal Dialer database (read/write).  The K95 Dialer
creates this file for you the first time you add, clone, or change an entry.

<p>

<dt><i>Your Personal K95 Read/Write Subdirectories:</i></dt>
<dd><tt>CERTS</tt> (X.509 certificates for SSL/TLS),
<tt>CRLS</tt> (X.509 certificate revocation lists for SSL/TLS),
<tt>KEYMAPS</tt> (key mapping files),
<tt>PHONES</tt> (dialing and network directories),
<tt>SCRIPTS</tt> (scripts),
<tt>SSH</tt> (SSH host keys),
<tt>TMP</tt> (temporary directory).  These are initially empty.  Some of them
are used by K95; for example to when adding SSH host keys when you make a
connection to a new host.  Others are for your own use; for example, for
installing X.509 certificates for hosts that you visit, personalized key
maps, your own scripts, etc.

confusing points, primarily for those who use K95 directly at its command
prompt.

<h3><a name="x10.1">10.1. K95's Initial Directory</a></h3>

Kermit 95's current directory when you first start it depends on how
you started it, which initialization files it executed, and whether an
environment variable named HOME is defined to be a valid directory name.

<p>

<ul>
<li>If you start K95 from a command window, it inherits its
initial directory from the command window's current directory.

<p>

<li>If you start K95 from the Dialer, its initial directory is your home
directory, which in turn is the value of the built-in Kermit variable,
<tt>\v(home)</tt>, unless the Dialer entry includes a login script that CD's
somewhere else.  <tt>\v(home)</tt> inherits the value of the environment
variable HOME, if it is defined, otherwise it is the root of your user
tree, e.g.:
<p>
<pre>
  C:\Documents and Settings\Olga\
</pre>
<p>

<li>If you start K95 from the Start menu, its initial directory is its
program directory.

<p>

<li>If you start K95 from a desktop shortcut, its initial directory is K95's
program directory, unless you have changed the properties of the shortcut to
specify a "Start in" directory.

<p>

<li>If you make a connection to WIKSD from outside and log in as yourself,
WIKSD's initial directory is the one specified in your Windows user profile,
if any, otherwise <tt>\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\</tt>.

<p>

<li>If you make an anonymous connection to WIKSD, its initial directory is
whatever the system administrator configured for anonymous users.

</ul>
<p>

Any of these can be changed by the initialization file sequence, except when
starting from the Dialer since, in that case, the instructions emitted by the
Dialer are executed <i>after</i> the initialization files.

<h3><a name="x10.2"><hr>10.2. K95's CD Command</a></h3>

To simplify navigation among K95's many directories, Kermit 95 has a new KCD
command that takes as an operand the symbolic name of any of the directories
that are significant to K95:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\Tmp\] K-95&gt; <u>kcd ?</u> Symbolic directory name, one of the following:
   appdata   desktop   exedir    inidir    startup   tmpdir
   common    download  home      personal  textdir
  [C:\Tmp\] K-95&gt; kcd <u>exedir</u>
  [C:\Program Files\Kermit 95\] K-95&gt;
</pre>
<p>

Unlike the variable names described below, such as <tt>\v(exedir)</tt>,
you can abbreviate symbolic names, use completion on them, etc, just like
any other command keyword.

<p>

The remainder of this section was written for version 1.1.21, but still
applies to version 2.00.

<p>

When Kermit 95 is installed the new way described in the <a
href="#files">previous section</a>, the CD command can be confusing.  Here
are a few tips that might help:

<p>
<ul>

<li>The CD command, when given with no operand, returns K95 to its
<tt>\v(home)</tt> directory.  If you don't like how <tt>\v(home)</tt> is
defined, you can always override it by defining a HOME environment variable
with the desired value.  This is done in <b>Control Panel . . System . .
Advanced . . Environment Variables</b> in newer Windows versions, or by
adding SET commands to <tt>C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt> in older ones.

<p>

<li>Remember that in K95 commands, directory or pathnames that contain spaces
must be enclosed in quotes or braces, e.g.:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>cd "c:/Documents and Settings/Olga/My Documents/"</u>
</pre>
<p>

<li>Since it is difficult and annoying to type such long pathnames, you
can use the K95 variables shown in the ORIENTATION command (example in 
previous section), for example:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>cd \v(personal)</u>               ; My personal Windows data tree
  K-95&gt; <u>cd \v(appdata)</u>                ; My personal K95 data tree
  K-95&gt; <u>cd \v(common)</u>                 ; K95 data tree for all users
  K-95&gt; <u>cd \v(exedir)</u>                 ; Directory where K95.EXE is started from
  K-95&gt; <u>cd \v(download)</u>               ; My personal K95 download directory
  K-95&gt; <u>cd \v(tmpdir)</u>                 ; My personal directory for temporary files
</pre>
<p>

<li>You can also refer to Windows environment variables in the CD or any
other command, as in the these examples:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>cd \$(HOMEDRIVE)\$(HOMEPATH)</u>  ; My Windows HOMEPATH
  K-95&gt; <u>cd \$(ALLUSERSPROFILE)</u>        ; Windows All Users
  K-95&gt; <u>cd \$(CommonProgramFiles)</u>     ; Common Program Files
  K-95&gt; <u>cd \$(TEMP)</u>                   ; Personal temporary directory
  K-95&gt; <u>cd \$(USERPROFILE)</u>            ; Personal Windows data tree
</pre>
<p>

You can get a listing of Windows environment variables by typing SET in a
CMD or Command Prompt or other shell window.

<p>

<li>You can define macros that take you to commonly visited directories:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>define appdata cd \v(appdata)</u>
  K-95&gt; <u>appdata</u>
</pre>
<p>

<li>You can take advantage of the SET CD PATH command, which lets you
type just the rightmost path segments in your CD commands.  Example:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>set cd path \v(appdata);\v(personal)</u> ; With this in effect...
  K-95&gt; <u>cd download</u>                          ; This works from anywhere
</pre>
<p>

<li>Remember you can use <tt>?</tt> for file/directory lists and Tab or Esc
for completion anywhere within a path, which can save you some head-scratching
and/or typing:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>cd /</u>
  K-95&gt; <u>cd "Doc&lt;Tab&gt;</u>uments and Settings/"<u>Olga/App&lt;Tab&gt;</u>ication Data/"...
</pre>
<p>

Actually it's a bit more complicated than shown because of the doublequotes;
at each step you have to delete the closing doublequote before proceeding to
the next path segment, but you'll get the hang of it quickly enough.

<p>

<li>Remember that K95 has a BACK command that returns you to its previous
directory.

<p>

<li>There is also a CDUP command that changes to the current directory's
superior directory (if any).

</ul>
<p>

You can get additional information about CD, BACK, CDUP, SET CD, or any other
command, by giving a HELP command for it at the K-95&gt; prompt, e.g.
"help set cd".

<h3><a name="x10.3"><hr>10.3. Where Is My Customization File?</a></h3>

K95 1.1.21 (and later), when installed from scratch, looks for your
<tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> file in your <tt>\v(appdata)</tt> directory.  If it
does not find it there, it looks in K95's program directory,
<tt>\v(exedir)</tt>.  In the old days, when we said "edit your customization
file", this generally meant something simple like:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>edit c:/k95/k95custom.ini</u>
</pre>
<p>

Now it means something like this:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>edit "C:/Documents and Settings/Olga/Application Data/Kermit 95/k95custom.ini"</u>
</pre>
<p>

But who wants to type all that?  Instead you can use this:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>edit \v(appdata)k95custom.ini</u>
</pre>
<p>

Of course if that's not where it really is you might need something more
elaborate, like this:

<p>
<pre>
  if exist \v(appdata)k95custom.ini edit \v(appdata)k95custom.ini
  else if exist \v(exedir)k95custom.ini edit \v(exedir)k95custom.ini
  else echo "Where is it?"
</pre>
<p>

<b>HINT:</b> If you installed K95 1.1.21 from patches and fear that you might
have multiple <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> files lurking in various directories, of
course you can find them all with Windows Search or Find.  Then edit each one
to include a line like this:

<p>
<pre>
  echo EXECUTING \v(user)'s \flongpathname(\fpathname(\v(cmdfile)))...
</pre>
<p>

Then when K95 starts, this line prints the full pathname of the
customization file that was actually executed.

<h3><a name="x10.4"><hr>10.4. Structure of <tt>.</tt>INI Files</a></h3>

In K95 1.1.21 and later, which can run remotely in its WIKSD guise,
adds a new complication to construction of K95's <tt>.INI</tt> files
because certain K95 commands are not legal in WIKSD.  These include:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Any commands that set up or make connections.
<li>Any commands having to do with terminal emulation or key mapping.
<li>Any commands related to printers.
<li>Any commands that access subprocesses or external programs.
<li>Probably some others too...
</ul>
<p>

Yet if you log in through WIKSD using your own Windows ID, then your own
<tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> file -- which is likely to contain many such commands
-- is executed.  If you are going to be accessing the same computer from its
physical keyboard and screen (or facsimile thereof) <i>and</i> remotely
via WIKSD, your <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> file should separate the commonly valid
commands from the ones that can only be executed by <tt>K95.EXE</tt> and not
by WIKSD.  It's easy.  Just put the common commands at the top, then:

<p>
<pre>
  if iksd end 0 IKSD Setup Complete.
</pre>
<p>

And then the rest of your K95 customizations.  If you do not protect commands
like SET TERMINAL, SET KEY, and so on, by IF [ NOT ] IKSD, you'll get tons of
error messages when you log in to WIKSD.  The same guidelines should be
followed by the system administrator when setting up the
<tt>K95.INI</tt> and <tt>K95SITE.INI</tt> files.  The <tt>K95*.INI</tt> files
that we distribute with version 1.1.21 have this structure already, but if
you install 1.1.21 by patching, your old <tt>.INI</tt> files are preserved.

<h3><a name="x10.5"><hr>10.5. Where is the File I Just Downloaded?</a></h3>

Rather than try to enumerate the rules and their relative precedence,
let's just say how to get this information during the transfer and after
the transfer:

<p>
<ul>
<li>While the transfer is in progress, the full path of the downloaded
file should be visible on your screen in the file-transfer display.
<li>When the transfer is complete, the file-transfer display should still
be visible in the Command screen (you might have to Alt-x back from the
Terminal screen to see it).  And of course you can always scroll back to
it with the Page Up key.
<li>At the <tt>K-95&gt;</tt> prompt, type the WHERE command, which tells you
where your files went.
</ul>
