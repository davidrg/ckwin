<h2>Changing Terminal Screen Size</h2>

This exercise shows you how to use Kermit commands to change the Terminal
screen size, and gives you some practice in switching between the Command and
Terminal screens, and in using Kermit commands.  We assume you already have a
connection and are in the Terminal screen.

<p>
<ul>
<li>Use Alt-X (hold down the Alt key, press the X key) to return to the
Command screen.
<p>
<li>At the <tt>K-95&#62;</tt> prompt, type:
<p>
<pre>
  set terminal height 42
</pre>
(or 43 for <a href="gloss.html#g_ansi">ANSI</a> terminal types).
By the way, you don't necessarily have to spell each word out all the way.
After typing each letter, type ? to see what the possibilities are.  If there
are more than one, type the next letter, and so on.  When only one possibility
remains, type Space to go on to the next word, or type Esc or Tab to complete
the current word automatically and go on to the next word.  Try this -- once you
get used to it, it will make Kermit commands less intimidating.  The same
methods work in other Kermit programs too, such as C-Kermit in UNIX or VMS,
and MS-DOS Kermit in DOS.
<p>
Remember to press the Enter key to enter the command.
<p>
<li>At the next <tt>K-95&#62;</tt> prompt, type:
<p>
<pre>
  set terminal width 132
</pre>
<p>
and then press Enter.
<p>
<li>Type the <tt>CONNECT</tt> command (you can abbreviate it to just
"<tt>C</tt>") and then Enter.  (HINT: You can also use Alt-X for this;
remember, Alt-x is a "toggle" between the Command and Terminal screens.)
</ul>
<p>
The Terminal screen should now be quite large (larger, perhaps than your
monitor).  If necessary, use the Font menu to adjust the font size for a
better fit.  (This is what the "Auto" font size should do for you
automatically, but unfortunately it doesn't work well.)
<p>
Now return to the Command screen again (Alt-X) and change the size back to
24 x 80 (or whatever it was before).  Let's use "command recall" for this:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Press the Up-Arrow key (or use Ctrl-P or Ctrl-B) until you see the
<tt>SET TERMINAL HEIGHT 42</tt> command.
<p>
<li>Use the Backspace key (or Ctrl-W) to erase "42" and replace it with
"24" (for <a href="gloss.html#g_ansi">ANSI</a> terminal types, replace
"43" with "25").
<p>
<li>Press the Enter key to enter the command.
<p>
<li>Repeat the previous procedure to recall and change the
<tt>SET TERMINAL WIDTH</tt> command.
<p>
<li>Return to the terminal screen (<tt>CONNECT</tt> or Alt-X).
</ul>
