The Hebrew character sets known to Kermit 95 are:
<p><pre>
  <i>Kermit Name    Type   Description</i>
   HEBREW-ISO    8-bit    <a href="gloss.html#g_iso">ISO</a> 8859-8 Latin/Hebrew
   HEBREW-7      7-bit    7-Bit Hebrew from Hebrew-model DEC VT100
   CP862         8-bit    Hebrew PC Code Page

<h3><a name="hbxfer">Hebrew File Transfer</h3>

Hebrew file transfer is fully described in <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>.
<p>
Commands:
<p><dl>
<dt><tt>SET TRANSFER CHARACTER-SET HEBREW-ISO</tt>
<dd>ISO 8859-8 Latin/Hebrew Alphabet
<p>
<dt><tt>SET FILE CHARACTER-SET HEBREW-ISO</tt>
<dd>ISO 8859-8 Latin/Hebrew Alphabet
<p>
<dt><tt>SET FILE CHARACTER-SET CP862</tt>
<dd>Hebrew PC Code Page
<p>
<dt><tt>SET FILE CHARACTER-SET HEBREW-7</tt>
<dd>DEC 7-Bit (VT100) Hebrew
</dl>
<p>
An invertible translation table between Latin/Hebrew and CP862 is used during
both terminal emulation and file transfer.  The translation table between
Hebrew-7 and Latin/Hebrew, however, is not invertible because these character
sets are different sizes.
<p>
Here is an example of uploading a Hebrew file from a PC to UNIX.  The PC
version is coded in the Hebrew PC code page, and the UNIX version is to be
stored in the 7-bit Hebrew character-set so it can be sent as network e-mail:
<p><pre>
C-Kermit> <u>set file character-set hebrew-7</u> ; I want 7-bit text for email
C-Kermit> <u>receive</u>                         ; Wait for the file.
<u>&#60;Alt-X&#62</u>                                   ; Escape back to the PC
K-95> <u>set file type text</u>                  ; Make sure we are in text mode
K-95> <u>set file character-set cp862</u>        ; File is in Hebrew PC code page
K-95> <u>set xfer character-set hebrew</u>       ; Send using ISO Latin/Hebrew
K-95> <u>send rab.oof</u>                        ; Send the file
</pre><p>
The file sender automatically tells the file receiver that the transfer
character-set is Hebrew.
<p>
The three Hebrew character sets are also available for use in Kermit's
TRANSLATE command, which translates a local file from one character-set to
another.  Thus you can use Kermit to convert a local file from, say,
Latin/Hebrew to Hebrew-7.
<p>
Kermit's Hebrew file transfer features can be used in conjunction with MS-DOS
Kermit 3.13 and later and C-Kermit 5A(189) and later (with which Kermit 95
shares the same translation tables to ensure consistent translations) and IBM
Mainframe Kermit 4.2 or later, which translates between Latin/Hebrew and IBM
CECP 424 (the Hebrew EBCDIC Country Extended Code Page).

<h3><a name="hbterm">Hebrew Terminal Emulation</h3>

In Kermit 95,
"Hebrew terminal emulation" means the use of Hebrew characters while emulating
VT100, VT320, ANSI, or other type of terminal, and translation between the
Windows encoding for Hebrew and the host encoding.
<p>
It does not mean right-to-left writing direction; thus it would be the
responsibility of the host application to place Hebrew characters in the
desired position on the screen by using escape sequences.  This should not
be surprising, however, since very few of the terminals that Kermit
emulates support right-to-left writing direction either.
<p>
Kermit 95's Hebrew support is widely used with Hebrew University's ALEPH
bibliographic software.

<h4>The PC Hebrew Character Set</h4>

Kermit 95 can be used to display Hebrew characters on the host if you
have the Hebrew code page, CP862, loaded on your PC.  In Windows 95, it is not
likely that you have this, or can have it, unless you have installed the
Israeli version of Windows; see the 
<a href="k95bugs.html">Kermit 95 Bug List</a> for more
information about this.
<p>

In Windows NT/2000/XP, we don't use code pages at all, but instead we use
Unicode, which NT supports.  It is recommended that you use a True Type
Unicode encoded font with Kermit 95.  The one that comes with Windows NT is
Lucida Console (fixed-pitch Unicode), but unfortunately this font does not
include a full set of Hebrew letters.  If you install an additional font that
does contain Hebrew characters you can leave everything as it is.  Otherwise,
you can use the bitmap (code page) fonts and instruct Kermit 95 to use your
Hebrew PC code page with:

<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL UNICODE OFF
  SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE 862
  SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET CP862
</pre><p>

The OS/2 version of Kermit 95 comes with a Hebrew "PC font" equivalent to
Code Page 862.  You can use this in fullscreen sessions only -- NOT in an OS/2
Window, and even then it works only if your video driver allows it.  In
Kermit/2, the commands:
<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL FONT 862
  SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET CP862
</pre><p>
actually attempts to load the Hebrew CP862 font into your video adapter
(this can't be done in Windows).

<p>

<h3><a name="hbcfg">Configuring K95 for Hebrew Terminal Emulation</h3>

Hebrew character-set translation is enabled during terminal emulation
via the commands:
<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET { HEBREW-ISO, HEBREW-7, CP862 }
  SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET CP862
  SET TERMINAL BYTESIZE 8    ; Not needed for Hebrew-7
</pre><p>
(choose the character set that is appropriate for the host or service
you are connecting to.)

<p>

<h3><a name="hbkey">Entering Hebrew Characters on the Keyboard</h3>

In Windows it is possible to install more than one
keyboard layout in the Keyboard Control Panel on the Input Locales
page.  When more than one Input Locale/Layout combination is defined,
you are required to choose one of them as the default, and to choose a
key combination (such as Left Alt + Shift) to switch among them.  This
is called the Switch-Locale key sequence.  The default Input-Locale is
the Input-Locale that each Window uses when it is opened.
<p>
For instance, it is possible to install:
<p><pre>
  Input Locale                                  Layout
  ------------------------------------------    ---------------
  English (United States)                       US
  Hebrew                                        Hebrew
</pre><p>
with "English (United States)" as the default input locale and a
Switch-Locale key sequence of "Left_Alt+Shift".  Since the keyboard
only has one alphabet on it, this "alphabet shift" key is needed to
switch between the two defined alphabets.  In Hebrew Windows, for
example, it is necessary to type Roman letters when you type Windows
file names or Kermit 95 commands and Hebrew letters when writing in
the Hebrew language.
<p>

In Windows NT/2000/XP, the Hot-key combination switches the Input-Locale for
the entire system.  In Windows 95/98/ME, the Input-Locale is switched only for
the current application window, allowing different applications to use
different languages at the same time.

<h4>Keyboard Shifting in Windows NT/2000/XP</h4>

In Windows NT/2000/XP, you can give the following commands to Kermit 95:
<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL UNICODE OFF ; if Hebrew characters are missing from font
  SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE 1255
  SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET CP1255
  SET TERMINAL REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET HEBREW-ISO <i>(or</i> HEBREW-7<i>)</i>
</pre><p>

When the current locale is "English (United States)" K95 receives Roman
characters from the keyboard.  When the current locale is "Hebrew" K95
receives Hebrew characters from the keyboard.  To toggle between the two,
press the Switch-Locale key sequence.

<p>

When issuing commands to K95 switch to the "English" locale and when
sending Hebrew characters to the host switch to the "Hebrew"
locale.  There is no limitation to mixing Roman and Hebrew
characters via this method at the K95 command prompt or in terminal
mode.

<p>

Note that only characters that are in the active code page may be delivered to
K95 from the keyboard.  In the above example code page 1255 is used because it
is available on all versions of NT and it contains all of the Roman characters
needed for English and the Hebrew characters used by CP862.  (CP862 is not
available on the U.S. version of NT but may be available on some international
versions.)

<p>

When issuing commands to Kermit 95 use the English Input-Locale and switch to
the Hebrew Input-Locale when Hebrew characters are necessary in command mode
for file names, or when sending characters to the host.  Note that an Alt- or
Ctrl- key combination can generate different values for each locale.

<h4>Windows 95/98/ME</h4>

When using Windows 9x/ME, locale switching does not work properly in 32-bit
console applications so Kermit 95 has to simulate the switching of keyboard
layouts.  Hebrew Windows 95 uses CP862 as its default code page for the DOS
and Windows-32 Console environments.  Therefore, both Roman and Hebrew
characters are available for display.

<p>
For 16-bit DOS applications the current locale is ignored.  All keystrokes
generate Roman letters regardless of what locales are installed.
<p>
In Kermit 95, both Left Alt-Shift and Ctrl-Shift are "hotkeys" that
toggle the Keyboard Input-Locale among those installed.  Each time K95
is started it uses the Default Input-Locale as set in the
Keyboard Control Panel until you switch it with Alt-Shift or Ctrl-Shift.
<p>
If CP862 is your PC's Console code page, K95 detects this automatically when
it starts and configure the Local Character-set to the same value.

<h3><a name="hbkbmode">Using Kermit 95's Hebrew Keyboard Mode</h3>

If you have a font with Hebrew characters, but lack a Hebrew keyboard and
driver, you can use Kermit 95's built-in Hebrew keyboard mode, to make Kermit
do the necessary key translations:
<ul>
<li>The \KkbHebrew verb, which may be assigned to any key.  It is assigned by
default to Ctrl-Alt-Shift-H.  It switches the main keypad (mostly the
lowercase letters) into Hebrew mode (see keymap below).  When the keyboard
is in Hebrew mode, the terminal type in the status line has "-H" appended
to it, for example "VT220-H".
<p>
<li>The \KkbEnglish verb to switch the main keypad back to English mode.
<p>
<li>The \KkbHebrew function is performed automatically in VT emulation if
the host application sends <tt>CSI ? 35 h</tt>, and the \KkbEnglish function
with <tt>CSI ? 35 l</tt>.
<p>
<li>Hebrew keyboard mode is cleared when you execute the \Kreset (reset
terminal) function, assigned to Alt-r by default.
</ul>
<p>
The Hebrew key layout associated with these verbs follows follows the layout
used by Hebrew WordPerfect, Windows, and Word.  The names of the Hebrew
letters are from the ISO 8859-8 Standard.  These are the key assignments when
the keyboard is in Hebrew mode, listed in three different orders for easy
lookup:
<p><pre>
<hr><i>Hebrew Order             Roman Order              QWERTY Keyboard Order</i><hr>  q = Slash                , = Taw                  q = Slash

  x = Samech               q = Slash                z = Zain
  g = Ayin                 r = Resh                 x = Samech
  ; = Terminal Pe          s = Dalet                c = Bet
  p = Pe                   t = Aleph                v = He
  . = Terminal Zade        u = Waw                  b = Nun
  m = Zade                 v = He                   n = Mem
  e = Qoph                 w = Apostrophe           m = Zade
  r = Resh                 x = Samech               , = Taw
  a = Shin                 y = Tet                  . = Terminal Zade
  , = Taw                  z = Zain                 / = Period
<hr>
</pre><p>
To use Kermit 95 with host-based Hebrew software such as ALEPH
(the Hebrew University library software), give these commands to Kermit:
<p>
<pre>
  SET TERMINAL BYTESIZE 8
  SET TERM CODE-PAGE 862
  SET TERM CHARACTER-SET HEBREW-ISO cp862
  SET TERM KEY HEBREW \372 \KKBHEBREW     ; F5 = Enter Hebrew keyboard mode
  SET TERM KEY HEBREW \373 \KKBENGLISH    ; F6 = Enter English keyboard mode
  SET TERM KEY HEBREW \374 \KDECF7        ; F7 = DEC F7 (for ALEPH software)
</pre><p>
Of course, you can assign the <tt>\KkbHebrew</tt>, <tt>\KkbEnglish</tt>, and
<tt>\KdecF7</tt> verbs to any other keys of your choice.
<p>
To define your own Hebrew key map, create a file containing the desired
<tt>SET TERM KEY HEBREW</tt> commands, in which the assigned values are CP862
values.  TAKE this file, and then whenever you execute the <tt>\KkbHebrew</tt>
verb, your keyboard will have the mappings defined in this file.
