<h2>Terminal Character Set Terminology and Mechanics</h2>

A terminal might be capable of displaying multiple character sets.  These are
chosen by the host application using mechanisms specified in
<a href="gloss.htm#g_iso">ISO</a> Standard 2022, which are summarized here.

<p>

A 7-bit character is one in which the 8th (high-order) bit is zero (0).  An
8-bit character's 8th bit is one (1).  A 7-bit character set has 128 7-bit
characters.  An "8-bit character set" is, in fact, composed of two 7-bit
character sets, one of them, the "left half," usually being <a
href="gloss.htm#g_ascii">ASCII</a> (ISO 646 International Reference Version),
while the "right half" contains the "special" characters needed for a
particular language, region, or writing system.

<p>

Standard-format character (such as ASCII and the ISO Latin Alphabets), are, in
turn, divided into Control and Graphic sections, as specified in ISO Standard
4873.  Nonstandard character sets do not necessarily observe this convention,
the classic example being PC code pages.  The following remarks apply only to
standard character sets.

<p>

From the terminal's character-set repertoire, six sets are available at once:
C0, C1, G0, G1, G2, and G3.  C0 and C1 each contain 32 control characters;
G0-G3 are graphic character sets of either 94 or 96 characters each.  Specific
graphic sets from the terminal's repertoire can be designated to G0-G3 by
escape sequences from the host or by the Kermit 95 command:

<p>
<pre>
  SET TERMINAL REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET <i>name {</i> G0, G1, G2, G3 <i>}</i>
</pre>
<p>

The terminal's active character set is composed of C0 and C1 controls, plus GL
(graphics left) and GR (graphics right).  GL tells which of the G0-G3 sets is
used if a 7-bit graphic character arrives; GR tells which set is used if an
8-bit graphic arrives.  Similarly, the C0 set is used when a 7-bit control
character arrives, and C1 is used when an 8-bit control character arrives.

<p>

Kermit 95's startup configuration for most ISO-2022 compliant terminals (such
as VT220/320) is: ASCII controls designated to C0, ASCII graphics to G0, ISO
6429 controls to C1, and the 96 characters of ISO 8859-1 Latin Alphabet 1 to
G1, G2, and G3.  GL refers to G0 and GR refers to G2.  This configuration can
be changed with the <tt>SET<tt> </tt>TERMINAL<tt>
</tt>REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET</tt> command or by character-set designation and
invocation escape sequences from the host; at any moment, the current layout
is revealed with the Kermit 95 command:

<p>
<pre>
  SHOW CHARACTER-SETS
</pre>
<p>

A common use for character-set switching is for displaying a combination
of ASCII characters, accented or non-Roman letters, and line- and box-drawing
and/or math symbol characters on the screen simultaneously.  For example,
in the DEC VT220/320, the host application might switch among ASCII, DEC
Multinational (for accented Roman letters), DEC Special (for line- and
box-drawing characters), and DEC Technical (for math symbols).

<p>

Eight-bit character sets can be used in the 7-bit communications environment
if the host computer supports <i>shifting</i>.  In the most common application
of this technique, the Shift-Out (SO, Ctrl-N) control character is sent before
any GR characters, then 8-bit characters are sent with their 8th bit removed,
and then Shift-In (SI, Ctrl-O) is sent to change back to GL characters.  In
other words, SO invokes G1 into GL, SI invokes G0 back to GL.  Kermit 95 obeys
these shifting directives when they come in, and uses them automatically
when sending characters if <tt>PARITY</tt> is not <tt>NONE</tt> and/or
<tt>TERMINAL</tt> <tt>TERMINAL BYTESIZE</tt> is 7, or if you force it do so
by using the ON option of the Kermit 95 command:

<p>
<pre>
  SET TERMINAL LOCKING-SHIFT <i>{</i> ON, OFF <i>}</i>
</pre>
<p>

Kermit 95 1.1.21 adds support for Unicode terminal emulation, in its UTF-8
form.  Unicode is a single character set that is a superset of all the other
character sets of the world.  In a UTF-8 terminal session, there is no
character-set switching.  In this case ISO-2022 can be used to switch the
terminal into UTF-8 mode, which is an "escape from ISO-2022 mode", and back
in to ISO-2022 mode, and that's all.  While in UTF-8 mode, all characters
come from Unicode.  Thus, for example, there are no VT100 special graphics
for line and box drawing since Unicode has its own line- and box-drawing
characters.  For this reason, VT100-specific applications might not work
in UTF-8 mode, even if Kermit is emulating a VT100, and this is proper
behavior.
