<h3><a name="intro"><hr>Introduction</a></h3>

This document offers step-by-step advice on how to install the Kermit 95
communications software.  Although most of this InstallShield installation
is self-explanatory, Kermit 95 includes some advanced features that must
be at least minimally configured to function properly.  Please leave this
browser window open and refer to it if you are stuck on a question that the
installation routine is asking you.

<p>

This document covers all the possible options you could install,
so it is possible that if you don't install all of the components, you
will not be prompted for information that is referenced here.

<p>

Also note that all of the links to additional documentation are links to The
<a href="http://www.kermitproject.org/">Kermit Project website</a>
and therefore require an active Internet connection.

<h3><a name="patch11"><hr>1. The K95 1.1 to 2.1 Upgrade</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<i>

If you are installing Kermit 95 for the first time, please skip to the 
<a href="#install">next section</a>.

</i>
</blockquote>
<p>

The Kermit 95 1.1 to 2.1 upgrade is, in fact, a full new installation;
thus the regular installation instructions following this section apply to it,
just as they do to a new installation.  <b>To apply the upgrade you must
already have an older version of Kermit 95 on your computer.</b>

<p>

A new installation is required because to get all K95 users into the new
directory structure, so we don't have an unsupportable parallel universe of
old and new layouts.  The upgrade installs K95 2.1 into the new
structure.  Your previous installation is left intact.

<p>

After upgrading, you will have to determine which files from your old
installation need to be migrated to which directories in the new one.
In the most common situations, your old Kermit 95 installation is confined
to a single directory tree, typically rooted at <tt>C:\K95</tt>.
In the new scheme, the data files that you have changed are stored in
Kermit 95's "appdata" directory (as explained in the
README file), typically:

<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>C:\Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings\<i>username</i>\Application&nbsp;Data\Kermit&nbsp;95\</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>

The two files that should always be moved are:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt></dt>
<dd>Your Kermit 95 customization file.
<p>
<dt><tt>DIALUSR.DAT</tt></dt>
<dd>Your personal Dialer database entries and customizations.
</dl>
<p>

Plus the contents of your old K95 CERTS, CRLS, DOWNLOAD, KEYMAPS, PHONES,
SCRIPTS, SSH, and TMP subdirectories, if any.

<p>

Other files might also need to be moved, including <tt>DIALORG.DAT</tt>, the
organization wide Dialer database if your site has one, and if you use Host
Mode, the host-mode data files and directories must be moved too.  It is
beyond the scope of this document to cover every possibility.  Instead,
visit:

<p>
<blockquote>

<a href="http://www.kermitproject.org/k95upgrade.html#migrate"><tt>http://www.kermitproject.org/k95upgrade.html#migrate</tt></a>

</blockquote>
<p>

for further instructions after you have upgraded to K95 2.1.

<p>

Once you have migrated all your files, you can remove the old K95
installation if you wish.



<h3><a name="patch20"><hr>1. The K95 2.x to 2.1.3 Upgrade</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<i>

If you are installing Kermit 95 for the first time, please skip to the 
<a href="#install">next section</a>.

</i>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>

The Kermit 95 2.1.3 upgrade requires that you have Kermit 95 2.0
or 2.1 installed.  The 2.1.3 upgrade will simply confirm the validity and
location of your current Kermit 95 2.x installation and then replace
files in your Kermit 95 2.x program directory to bring it up to Kermit
95 2.1.3.  It will also create a folder called Backups and copy any files
that a replaced so that you can restore your 2.x installation by doing a
Remove from Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.  The installer will
transfer your existing registration information from your 2.x files.

<p>

If you are installing the Crypto update, you will also be given the option
to add an association to make Kermit 95 the default program to handle
SSH connections.

<p>

The 2.1.3 update also includes a newer version of the Everson Mono Terminal
font.  The installer will give you the option to install or update this
depending on what you did with the font during the 2.0 install.

<h3><a name="install"><hr>2. The Installation</a></h3>

<b><i><a name="sect2.1">2.1: Initial Dialogs</a></i></b>

<p>

To install Kermit 95 you must have a valid K95 serial number.  If you
don't have one, stop now and contact your distributor to obtain one.  If
you are installing from a shrinkwrapped CDROM, your serial numbers are in
the package, usually stapled to the registration card.  If you are installing
an electronically distributed copy, the distributor should have furnished
you with a serial number.  Bulk and site license copies are preregistered.

<p>

The first few dialogs should be familiar if you've ever installed Windows
applications before.  The first one that requires some extra thought and
attention is:

<p>

<b>Setup Type</b>

<p>

Two types are offered, <b>Typical</b> and <b>Custom</b>.  If you choose the
<b>Typical</b> option Kermit 95 is installed with its base files and also
the files necessary to make secure connections with SSH, SSL, TLS, SRP and
Kerberos.  There are no additional configuration questions except for where to 
create shortcuts.

<p>

If you choose <b>Custom</b> you are taken to the the Select Components screen.
The advanced Kermit 95 components listed here extend Kermit's capabilities,
but may require some additional configuration.  You should be clear what each
component does and that you need it before selecting any of them.

<p>

<b>Select Components</b>

<p>

Here you choose which optional components of Kermit 95 you want to install.
Certain of the optional components require that you provide special
configuration information so they can function properly.  Here is a list of
the components, what they do, and any special information that you should be
ready to provide.  <b>Note that security-related components are not included
in the export version due to USA export law; our export license application
is pending.</b>

<p>
<dl>

<dt><b>SSH, SSL, TLS & SRP</b> (NOT INCLUDED WITH EXPORT VERSION)</dt>

<dd><i>Selected by default.</i> This option installs all the necessary
files to use Kermit 95 to create secure connections using all of the security
protocols listed.  While the installer will not ask you for any additional
configuration info, you will have some post-install configuration for any of
these security protocols to work.  Instructions for using Kermit 95 as an SSH
client <a href="http://www.kermitproject.org/sshclient.html">are available
on our web site.</a>  Look
<a href="http://www.kermitproject.org/security.html#x4">HERE</a> for details
on using the other methods such as SRP, TLS and SSL.</dd>

<p>

<dt><b>SRP FTP</b> (NOT INCLUDED WITH EXPORT VERSION)</dt>

<dd><i>Selected by default.</i> This options adds the cryptographic APIs
necessary to do SRP in Kermit 95's FTP mode.</dd>

<p>

<dt><b>Kerberos</b> (NOT INCLUDED WITH EXPORT VERSION)</dt>

<dd><b><i>IMPORTANT: It is best not to install this option if you already have
any other Kerberos program installed.</i></b> These files are required if you
need to make authenticated and/or encrypted connections using the Kerberos 4
and/or 5 security protocols, <b>and</b> if you have not already installed a
Windows-based Kerberos system (like the one from MIT).

<p>

If you think you may already have Kerberos support installed, first try
installing Kermit 95 without the Kerberos option.  Then try to make a
Kerberized telnet connection, if it does not work, you can try to use the
Kerberos support supplied with Kermit 95.  Do this by going to the Add/Remove
Programs Control Panel item, and clicking on Change/Remove for the K95
program.  Then you can select the Modify option and install the Kerberos
component.  It is important that you <b>not</b> install the Kerberos files in
the Kermit 95 distribution unless you have to.  You may be already using a
customized distribution that, for instance, requires the use of hardware
smartcards for you key.  Installing additional Kerberos files in this instance
will only confuse matters.  Best to contact your Kerberos realm administrator
if you are uncertain about what to do.

<p>

If you install the Kerberos support files, the installer will also install
the following configuration files in your default Windows directory
(if you do not already have them):

<p>
<ul>
<li>KRB.CON - Kerberos 4 Realm/Server mapping
<li>KRBREALM.CON - Kerberos 4 Domain/Realm mapping
<li>KRB5.INI - Kerberos 5 configuration file
</ul>
<p>

You need to at least know the host name of your KDC and your default
realm in order to create useful configuration files.  If you are not sure
about any of this, it would be best to not install Kerberos support at this
point.  You can gather the necessary information and then run this installer
again to add in Kerberos support.  Also be aware that if your company or
institution supports Kerberos, it is likely that they have customized
initialization files that you can download and use.  The Installer never
replaces existing files that it finds in place.

<p>

<dt><b>IKS for NT/2000/XP</b></dt>

<dd><i>This component is an option only on NT/2000 or XP.</i> Selecting
this option installs a Kermit file-transfer and management server on your
PC.  IKS, or Internet Kermit Service, is a powerful alternative to running an
FTP server on your PC.  It allows authenticated users (using Kermit 95's full
range of secure authentication options) or anonymous users to connect to your
PC to upload and download files as well as do basic file management commands
(when authorized).  Since it is based on Kermit 95, it provides all of Kermit
95's file collision handling options as well as access to Kermit 95's script
langauge.  See the <a
href="http://www.kermitproject.org/wiksduser.html">user's Guide</a> and the
<a href="http://www.kermitproject.org/wiksdadmin.html">Administrator's
Guide</a> for a better idea of what the IKS is capable of.  Because IKS is
installed as a service and started by default, you should be aware of the
security implications of installing it.  The installer will ask you several
questions in order to build a basic configuration file, IKSD.KSC, for IKS.
These questions will be covered in detail later in this document.

<p>

<dt><b>Historical Utils</b></dt>

<dd>These standalone utilities provide functions that are now incorporated in
the Kermit 95 program.  While they are no longer necessary, we provide them as
an option for those who might miss them.

<p>

<dt><b>Hostmode</b></dt>

<dd>Hostmode implements a basic BBS-like file-transfer and file-management
system using the Kermit 95 script language.  While it is a good example of the
power of Kermit 95's scripting capabilities, it is limited in function
relative to the IKS which provides all the functionality of Hostmode and much,
much more.  So it is being phased out.  If you need basic BBS-like
functionality on Windows 95/98/ME, then you might consider using Hostmode.

</dl>

<b><i><a name="sect2.2">2.2: Registry, Desktop and Start Menu Options</a></i></b>

<p>

Next the installer asks a series of questions to get your preferences about
how and where Kermit 95 should be added to the registry, desktop and/or Start
Menu.  You do not need to make any changes to the registry, or add anything to
your desktop or Start Menu if you do not want to.  These options are all to
make Kermit 95 more convenient to use.

<p>

<b>Registry</b>

<p>

First, the installer asks about making changes to the registry.  You can
optionally create and association between files with the extension .KSC
(Kermit SCript Files) and the Kermit 95 program.  This allows you to simply
double-click on a .KSC file and have it be run by the Kermit 95 program.  This
is handy for creating a quick shortcut on your desktop to your
commonly-accessed host systems.  And you can make Kermit 95 your default
telnet handler.  This means that if you are browsing a site on the Web that
provides a link that must be accessed via telnet, Kermit 95 is launched
to make that connection.

<b>Desktop and Start Menu</b>

<p>

Next you can to choose what shortcuts you want to create on the Desktop and on
the Start Menu.  Then on the dialog following this, you can specify if you
want to create the icons for All Users of the system, or just the user that is
currently logged in.


<p>

<b><i><a name="sect2.3">2.3: Everson Mono Terminal Font</a></i></b>

<p>Kermit 95 2.0 comes with a monospaced font called Everson Mono Terminal
(EMT) that covers a wider range of languages and scripts than most other
monospace fonts and is well-suited for use with the K95 GUI terminal emulator
on Windows NT, 2000, or XP.  EMT's repertoire includes most of the non-Han
characters in the Base Multilingual Plane of Unicode, including Latin,
Cyrillic, Greek, Coptic, Arabic, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian, Runes, Ogham,
Canadian Syllabics, Cherokee, Math, Symbols, Line and Box Drawing
Characters (including the new Unicode 3.1 Terminal Emulation Characters),
Dingbats, and APL.  Not supported (besides Han) are Indic, Hangul, Ethiopic,
Syriac, Thai, Lao, Myanmar, and Braille.</p>

<p>EMT is <i>not</i> installed by default since it tends not to look good on
Windows 95, 98, or ME due to differences in the Win9x/ME vs NT/2K/XP
rasterizer, although the results can vary depending on whether your Windows
system has such items as Font Smoothing or Clear Type installed or enabled,
and also with the font size and fore- and background colors.  If you install
EMT on Win9x/ME, K95 uses it by default, in which case you might want to
switch to a different font, such as Courier New or Lucida Console (if
available) in the Font menu on the K95 GUI Toolbar.  On the other hand, you
might need it to display certain languages that you can't see in any other
monospace font.</p>

<p><b>Important Note:</b> If you are installing Kermit 95 on a Windows
NT/2000/XP and you do not have Administrator privileges, the font will
<b>not</b> be installed.  You must have Admin privileges to write to the Font
directory.  In this case the font is copied to the Fonts sub directory under
where the program files are installed, by default this would be
<tt>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Kermit&nbsp;95\Fonts\</tt>.  This way you can
install it yourself once you are able to gain Admin privileges</p>

<p>Everson Mono Terminal is distributed with Kermit 95. It may not be
further distributed.  Everson fonts are available on
at <a href="http://www.evertype.com">www.evertype.com</a>


<h3><a name="config"><hr>3. Special Configuration</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<i>

This section applies only to users who have selected the <b>Custom</b>
install type and who are installing IKS for NT/2000/XP and/or Kerberos.

</blockquote>
</i>


<p>

<b><i><a name="sect3.1">3.1: Kerberos Configuration Files</a></i></b>

<p>

As stated above, three files are required to configure Kerberos authentication
and encryption for Windows; two are for Kerberos 4 support, KRB.CON and
KRBREALM.CON and one for Kerberos 5 support, KRB5.INI.  Basically, these files
supply two primary pieces of configuration information, Domain-to-Realm
mapping and Realm-to-Server mapping.  If this is sounding like Greek to you,
please take a look at our <a
    href="http://www.kermitproject.org/security80.html#x4">installation and
configuration help file</a> for details and links that should help make this
more intelligible.  Also check with your local SysAdmin or on your company's
or institution's IntraNet for details on how to configure Kerberos clients for
your specific environment.

<p>

As the Kerberos support files are installing, and if you do not already have
all three Kerberos configuration files on your system, the Installer asks you
the following series of questions so that it can build the configuration files
(you have the option to bail out of this process both at the beginning and
then right before the files are created):

<ul>

<li><b>Default Realms</b> - these are the Kerberos 4 and 5 realms that are the
    default for your environment.  Often they are the same; if they are, you can
    leave the Kerberos 5 realm blank.</b>

<li><b>Does DNS provide hostname/domain to realm mapping?</b> - this Yes/No
    question allows you to include, or not include, a directive in the
    configuration files that tells the Kerberos client program to query the DNS
    for this information.  Be careful with this one; if you say yes, and your DNS
    does not provide this information, Kermit 95 will appear to hang for a long
    time when attempting to make Kerberized connections.

<li><b>Domains to be Mapped</b> - here you can enter up to six domains that
    you want to map to the default realm that you specified on the first dialog.
    There are two screens with room for three domains each.  Even if you are
    certain that your DNS provides this information, you should fill in the
    domains you know.

<li><b>Does DNS provide realm to server mapping?</b> - similar to the above
    question about information from the DNS server.  Same cautions apply.

<li><b>Kerberos Server</b> - the name of the machine that serves all the
    Kerberos requests for your network.

<li><b>Realms to be mapped</b> - provide the name of at least your default
    realm and add any that you need to have associated with the Kerberos server
    you entered in the previous dialog.

</ul>

<p>

You should then receive a confirmation screen which lets you confirm the
creation of the configuration files or cancel them.

<p>

<b><i><a name="sect3.2">3.2: IKS Configuration File</a></i></b>

<p>

If you selected the IKS file-transfer and file-management server as a
component to install, you are prompted with the following series of questions
that build a basic configuration file for IKS.  The file is called
<tt>IKSD.KSC</tt> and is stored in the same directory as the program files.

<ul>

<li><b>Enable system logging</b> - This Yes/No question allows you to tell IKS
whether or not you want to write events into the System Events log on NT/2000
and XP.  These log entries are viewable with the Event Viewer under the
Application section.  Choosing "No" writes the line SET SYSLOG NONE to the
IKSD.KSC file.  Selecting "Yes" brings up the next dialog.

<li><b>System Logging Options</b> - Here you can choose which events you would
like to record in the System Events log.  (You won't get these options if you
said No to the first IKS question.)

<li><b>Have IKS keep it's own log of file transfers?</b> - Another Yes/No
question; this allows you to turn on or off a log of any file transfers that
occur between your IKS and a client PC.  This log includes detailed
information on the time, CPS, etc. of the transfer.

</ul>

<p>

The <tt>IKSD.KSC</tt> file create by the installer barely scratches
the surface of the kind of customization you can accomplish with this
file.  Please read the <a
href="http://www.kermitproject.org/wiksdadmin.html">Administrator's
Guide</a> for more details.  The guide is a work in progress, but should
provide enough information to do things like: allowing anonymous access,
setting a root directory to "jail" various classes of users, do special
configuration based on the user who logs in, etc...


<h3><a name="postinst"><hr>4. Where To Go From Here</a></h3>

After the installer has completed, be sure to read the README file, which
the installer displays for you if you say yes (but only if you are not
required to reboot after the install.)  This is important especially
if you have used previous releases of Kermit 95, since this version moves
things around a bit.

<p>

Now you should have a Kermit 95 installation with the desired features working
as expected, which is a good staring point but there is a lot more that you
can do to make the product more useful to you.  Begin by reading the tutorial
and manual which you can access from the K95 Documentation icon or Start-menu
item (if you elected to install them), or from the K95 Dialer's Help menu, or
with the K95 <tt>MANUAL</tt> command.

<p>

As a final step, the installer offers to start the Dialer for you.  A good way
to get started with K95 is with the Dialer and the K95 manual on your screen
at the same time.  Create some connections and launch them -- it's easier than
you might think!
