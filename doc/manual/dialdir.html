<title>Kermit 95 - Dialing Directory Format</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<h2>Dialing Directory Format</h2>

The dialing and networks directories are described thoroughly in Chapter 5
of <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>.
<p>
Very briefly . . .  A <b>dialing directory</b> is a
<a href="gloss.htm#g_plain">plain-text</a> file containing one or more entries.
You can create or edit directory files with any text editor that handles
plain-text files: Notepad, Wordpad, or EDIT in Windows; ED or EDIT in OS/2.
Or with EMACS if you have it.
<p>
Each entry is on a line by itself and has the following simple format:
<p>
<pre>
  <i>name   phone-number   ; optional comment</i>
</pre>
<p>
Example:
<p>
<pre><hr>ATTmail     +1 (800) 624 5123      ; AT&T Mail (Easylink), USA
ATTmail     +1 (416) 502 3000      ; AT&T Mail (Easylink), Canada
ATTmail    +81 3 5568 9134         ; AT&T Mail (Easylink), Japan
ATTmail   +852 3003 4900           ; AT&T Mail (Easylink), Hong Kong
ATTmail    +44  (71) 537 4121      ; AT&T Mail (Easylink), UK<hr></pre>
<p>
This shows how the same name can be associated with multiple phone numbers.
<i>Comments</i> are optional and begin with a semicolon preceded by at least one
space, or else at the beginning of the line.  Spacing is free-form.  The only
requirements are that the name must contain no spaces or tabs (or if it does,
it must be enclosed in braces) and at least one space or tab must separate the
name from the telephone number.
<p>
The <i>phone-number</i> may be in literal or portable format.  Numbers
starting with + are portable and must include a country code.  Parentheses,
hyphens, periods, and slashes within a phone number are ignored.  You may
include special dialing instructions for your modem in the phone number, such
as comma to insert a pause.
<p>
In a <b>network directory</b>, a network type and host name or address appears
instead of the phone number, possibly followed by additional network-specific 
information, for example
<p>
<pre><hr>CompuServe        tcp/ip compuserve.com
Delphi		  tcp/ip delphi.com
Dow-Jones	  tcp/ip djnr.dowjones.com
Weather           tcp/ip madlab.sprl.umich.edu 3000
Weather           tcp/ip wind.atmos.uah.edu 3000<hr></pre>
<p>

explanation of telephone numbers, dialing procedures, and the dialing
and network directories.
