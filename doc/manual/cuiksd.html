The Internet Kermit Service Daemon (IKSD) is C-Kermit 7.0 running as an
Internet service, similar to an FTP or Telnet server.  It executes Telnet
protocol just like a Telnet server and it transfers files like an FTP server.
But unlike an FTP server, IKSD uses the Kermit file transfer protocol.
<p>
An IKSD may be accessed on TCP port 1649 using any Telnet client that allows a
port specification and also includes Kermit protocol (and, as noted
<a href="#dia">below</a>, it may also be accessed by traditional serial
communication programs too).  Kermit Project clients are recommended for best
results, but third-party commercial, shareware, or freeware clients may also
be used.
<p>
To access the IKSD at the Kermit Project, instruct your Telnet client to
make a connection to:
<p><pre>
  <a href="telnet://kermit.columbia.edu:kermit">kermit.columbia.edu kermit</a>
</pre><p>
or if that doesn't work:
<p><pre>
  <a href="telnet://kermit.columbia.edu:1649">kermit.columbia.edu 1649</a>
</pre><p>
The syntax for specifying the TCP port number varies from client to client.
(For starters, try clicking on the link above...)

<p><hr><b><a name="why">WHY IKSD?</a></b><p>
[<a href="#csm">Next</a>] [<a href="#top">Top</a>]<p>

Why an Internet Kermit Service Daemon when there are already FTP servers?
<ul>
<li>Like FTP, Kermit provides a service that can be accessed from many
different platforms with a consistent set of commands, but unlike FTP,
these commands include programming constructions such as variables,
arrays, looping and decision mechanisms, and local and remote procedure
calls, thus allowing file transfer and management operations of arbitrary
complexity to be easily automated.
<p>
<li>Like FTP, Kermit provides both text- and binary-mode data transfer, as
well as file management capabilities.  But Kermit also offers numerous
features lacking from FTP:
<p><ol>
<li>Kermit translates character sets.  This includes the new
sets that include the Euro symbol (required in all of Western Europe).
So unlike with FTP, you can send your Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese,
Hebrew, Greek, Russian, or Japanese text from a PC to UNIX (etc) without
turning it to gibberish (other languages too, of course).
<p>
<li>Filename collision options (what to do when a file arrives that has the
same name as an existing file) like backup, rename, reject, overwrite, update
(reject if not newer).  No transferring files needlessly when you already have
them; no destroying important files by accident when the host sends a file
that happens to have the same name.
<p>
<li>Kermit offers flexible file selection mechanisms (like "please
send me the files whose names match this pattern, that were created
between these two dates, that are larger than such-and-such a size but
smaller than some other size, except don't send any files from this exception
list, and don't bother sending any files that are older versions of the ones
I have already").
<p>
<li>Preservation of timestamps and permissions.  Timestamps are what allow
the update feature to work.  Permissions are important for security
reasons, and also to allow executables to still be executable after transfer
(so in UNIX, for example, you don't always have to remember to "chmod +x" a
program or shell script after transfer before you can run it.)
<p>
<li>Automatic per-file text/binary mode switching.  No more "set file type
text", transfer all your text files, then "set file type binary" and
transfer all your binary files.
<p>
<li>Directory-tree transfer.  You can use Kermit to transfer a directory and
all its files, and all its subdirectories and all their files, etc etc, not
only between like platforms, but also from (say) a PC to UNIX or VMS, or VMS
to UNIX, or any other combination, automatically switching between text and
binary mode for each file, converting text-file formats and character sets
from the source to destination platforms, yet still sending binary files
without conversion.  This has never been possible before.
</ol>
<p>
<li>Unlike FTP, Kermit supports atomic file movement, in which the source
file, the destination file, or both can be deleted (or renamed, or moved) when
and only when it has been transferred successfully, as part of the transfer
operation itself.
<p>
<li>Unlike most FTP implementations, Kermit supports recovery of interrupted
binary-mode transfers from the point of failure.  You can even use it to
recover interrupted FTP transfers when FTP itself does not offer this option.
<p>
<li>Unlike standard FTP, Kermit can transfer data through firewalls,
proxies, and network address translators on a single well-known port
(unless the TCP port for the connection has been explicitly filtered).
<p>
<li>Unlike FTP, Kermit can transfer data across a combination of transports
(e.g. dial-up to a terminal server and from there access IKSD on an Internet
host).
<p>
<li>Unlike FTP, Kermit offers the 
ability to drive automated tasks from the server, even when the client
does not support them.  The server itself can be scripted.
<p>
<li>IKSD keeps an active-sessions database that can be monitored in realtime
by the sysadmin to see who is logged in and what they are doing.
<p>
<li>Unlike traditional Kermit use over Telnet, anonymous access is possible,
and the considerable overhead of the intervening Telnet server and
pseudoterminal service is eliminated.  Given a Telnet client with a good
Kermit protocol implementation, file transfer performance is about the same
as FTP.
</ul>

<p><hr><b><a name="csm">CLIENT/SERVER MODE</a></b><p>
[<a href="#iia">Next</a>] [<a href="#why">Prev</a>] [<a href="#top">Top</a>]<p>

IKSD can be used interactively by typing commands at its prompt (just
as you would use C-Kermit), or in client/server mode.
<p>
A client/server connection is possible (as far as we know) only with
Kermit Project Telnet clients (since third-party Kermit implementations rarely
implement features beyond the bare minimum, and therefore don't include
client commands).  Recommended clients include:
<p><ul>
<li><a href="https://kermitproject.org/k95.html">Kermit 95</a> for Windows 95/98/NT and OS/2
<li><a href="https://kermitproject.org/mskermit.html">MS-DOS Kermit</a> for DOS and Windows 3.1
<li><a href="https://kermitproject.org/ckermit.html">C-Kermit</a> for UNIX, VMS, VOS, OS-9, etc.
</ul>
If you do not have one of these, skip ahead to the <a href="#iia">next
section</a>.
<p>
To make a client/server connection, tell your Telnet client to:
<p><pre>
  set host kermit.columbia.edu 1649     ; <i>(C-Kermit or Kermit 95)</i>
  set port tcp kermit.columbia.edu 1649 ; <i>(MS-DOS Kermit)</i>
</pre><p>
Now log in to the server like this:
<p><pre>
  remote login <i>username password</i>
</pre><p>  
Since you probably don't have a Columbia user ID, you would normally supply
"anonymous" (spelled out all the way) or "ftp" (a synonym for "anonymous")
as the username, and your email address as the password, for example:
<p><pre>
  remote login anonymous ivan@abccorp.com
  remote login ftp olga@xyzcorp.com
</pre><p>  
Note that you can't send any commands other than REMOTE LOGIN, REMOTE LOGOUT,
REMOTE HELP, REMOTE EXIT, and BYE to the IKSD before you have logged in.
Also note that when your client is C-Kermit 7.0 and later, LOGIN and
LOGOUT may be given without the REMOTE prefix:
<p><pre>
  login anonymous ivan@abccorp.com
  login ftp olga@xyzcorp.com
</pre>
Ditto for Kermit 95 1.1.18 Beta.

<p>
Once logged in, you are situated at the root of the /pub/ftp tree.  Use:
<p><pre>
  remote directory
</pre><p>  
for a list of directories you can access, then use "remote cd" to change to
the desired directory, for example:
<p><pre>
  remote cd kermit
</pre><p>  
Whenever you change directories like this, you will receive an orientation
message describing what is available in this area.  If you would like to
disable these messages, tell your client to:
<p><pre>
  remote set cd-message off
</pre><p>  
(This command is new to C-Kermit 7.0 and K95 1.1.18).
<p>
To find out what commands the server will accept, type:
<p><pre>
  remote help
</pre><p>  
Consult your MS-DOS Kermit, C-Kermit, or K95 manual for detailed descriptions.
A brief summary follows; syntax may vary according to the Kermit client.
Shortcut R-commands (like RCD, RDIR, etc) are available in C-Kermit 7.0 and
K95 1.1.18:
<p><dl>
<dt><b>[ REMOTE ] LOGIN <i>[ username [ password ] ]</i></b>
<dd>Log in to the server.  If you don't include a username, you will be
prompted on a separate line; ditto for the password (and in this case, the
password will not echo).  Note: RLOGIN is not a shortcut for REMOTE LOGIN;
RLOGIN makes a connection to the host's "login" port, just like the UNIX
"rlogin" command; however, the REMOTE keyword is optional.
<p>
<dt><b>[ REMOTE ] LOGOUT</b>
<dd>Log out from the server.  You can also use BYE or HANGUP, or (in newer
Kermit versions) REMOTE EXIT (REXIT) or, simply, CLOSE.
<p>
<dt><b>GET <i>filespec</i></b>
<dd>Ask the server to send the specified file or files.
<p>
<dt><b>REMOTE DIRECTORY <i>[ filespec ]</i> (RDIR)</b>
<dd>Ask the server to send a directory listing.
<p>
<dt><b>REMOTE CD <i>directory</i> (RCD)</b>
<dd>Ask the server to change to the given directory.
<p>
<dt><b>REMOTE PWD <i>directory</i> (RPWD)</b>
<dd>Ask the server to display its current directory.
<p>
<dt><b>REMOTE HELP (RHELP)</b>
<dd>Ask the server to list commands you can send to it.
<p>
<dt><b>REMOTE SET <i>parameter value</i> (RSET)</b>
<dd>Ask the server to change the given parameter to the given value.
Type "remote set ?" for a list of possible values.
<p>
<dt><b>REMOTE TYPE <i>filename</i> (RTYPE)</b> 
<dd>Ask the server to display the given file on your screen.
<p>
<dt><b>FINISH</b>
<dd>Exit client/server mode.  Follow this command by CONNECT
to access the IKSD prompt.
</dl>
<p>
The following client commands are generally <i>not</i> accepted by the IKSD
from anonymous users:
<dl><dt><b>SEND <i>filespec</i></b>
<dd>(Since most users do not have write access to our file system.)
Ditto for REMOTE DELETE, REMOTE MKDIR, REMOTE RMDIR, REMOTE COPY,
REMOTE RENAME, etc.
<p>
<dt><b>REMOTE HOST <i>command</i> (RHOST)</b>
<dd>Access to host commands is not allowed.  Ditto for REMOTE WHO (RWHO).
<p>
<dt><b>MAIL <i>address</i></b>
<dd>Anonymous users may not send email.  Ditto for REMOTE PRINT (RPRINT).
</dl>	

<dl><dt><i>Example:</i>
<dd>Suppose you want to pick up the latest C-Kermit Beta test source files from
the Kermit Project archive on a daily basis, transferring only those that have
changed since last time (error handing not shown).
<p><pre>
  set host kermit.columbia.edu 1649  ; <i>Make the connection</i>
  remote login ftp olaf@wwwcorp.com  ; <i>Log in</i>
  remote cd kermit/test/text         ; <i>Change to desired directory</i>
  set file collision update          ; <i>Use update mode</i>
  fast                               ; <i>Use fast file-transfer settings (1)</i>
  mget makefile ck[cuw]*.[cwh]       ; <i>Get all .txt files that changed (2)</i>
  bye                                ; <i>Log out and disconnect</i>
</pre></dl><p>

Notes:<ol><li>Fast file transfer settings are the default in C-Kermit 7.0 and
Kermit 95.
<p>
<li>Patterns incorporating character lists or ranges and string
lists are new to C-Kermit 7.0 and K-95 1.1.18.
</ol>

<p><hr><b><a name="iia">INTERACTIVE IKSD ACCESS</a></b><p>
[<a href="#swm">Next</a>] [<a href="#csm">Prev</a>] [<a href="#top">Top</a>]<p>

The IKSD can be accessed directly by your Telnet client's CONNECT command or
terminal emulator (no particular terminal emulation is expected, needed, or
used).  For direct access with a Kermit Project client, use a
TELNET command rather than SET HOST (or add a CONNECT command after your SET
HOST command).  For other clients, follow the instructions for making a Telnet
connection.  
<p>
Now you should see Username and Password prompts.  Respond to them just as you
would if logging into UNIX or VMS, e.g.:
<p><pre>
  Username: <u>olga</u>
  Password: <u>secret</u>  <i>(The password does not echo)</i>
</pre><p>
Underlining indicates material that you type.  Press the Enter or Return
key at the end of the underlined text.
<p>
If you do not have a user ID on the server system, supply a username of
"anonymous" or "ftp", and your email address as the password:
<p><pre>
  Username: <u>anonymous</u>
  Password: <u>olga@olgacorp.com</u>
</pre><p>
Once you have logged in successfully, you will see the IKSD interactive
command prompt, something like:
<p><pre>
  (/users/olga/) IKSD&#62;
</pre><p>
The current directory is shown in parentheses.  For anonymous users, this
is initially the root of the /pub/ftp tree (shown as "/"):
<p><pre>
  (/) IKSD&#62;
</pre><p>
<p>
What you see is nothing more than C-Kermit 7.0 with its prompt set to
say "IKSD" instead of "C-Kermit".  You can use any commands here that are
accepted by C-Kermit 7.0, as described in the manual,
<a href="ckb2.html"><cite>Using C-Kermit</cite></a>, as augmented by the
C-Kermit 7.0 release notes,
<a href="https://www.kermitproject.org/ckermit70.html"><tt>C-Kermit 7.0 update notes</tt></a>, except that:
<p><ul>
<li>Access to the system is disallowed (e.g. by RUN, PUSH, REDIRECT, "!").
<li>Secondary connections may not be made (SET HOST, TELNET, SET LINE, DIAL, etc).
<li>Write access to the file system is disabled if you are logged in
anonymously.
</ul>
<p>
If you have no idea what to type at the IKSD prompt, try typing the word
HELP and then pushing the Enter or Return key.
<p>
For file-transfer purposes, interactive-mode IKSD is like C-Kermit in remote
mode.  If you tell it to SEND a file, you must get your client to receive it.
All modern Kermit programs (MS-DOS Kermit 3.15 and later, C-Kermit 6.0 and
later, and all versions of K95) support the 
"<a href="https://kermitproject.org/case03.html">autodownload</a>"
feature for Kermit protocol, but you might have to enable it first with:
<p><pre>
  set terminal autodownload on
</pre><p>
(Autodownload is enabled by default in Kermit 95 and in C-Kermit 7.0; it must
be explicitly enabled in C-Kermit 6.x and in MS-DOS Kermit.)
<p>
Assuming you have autodownload enabled in your client, you can initiate all
file transfers from the IKSD prompt:<p>
<ul>
<li>SEND makes the client receive automatically.
<li>GET makes the client enter server mode so it can read the GET request.
</ul>
and so on.  If your Telnet client does not support autodownloads, you'll need
to give whatever commands (or menu item choices, or button pushes) are
required to get the local end of the file transfer going.
<p>
Of course, you can't send files <i>to</i> the IKSD unless you have
the appropriate write permission, which is generally lacking for anonymous
users.
<p>
It is beyond the scope of this document to explain all that is possible
at the IKSD prompt.  That is the subject of a 
<a href="ckb2.html">622-page book</a> augmented by
about a megabyte of online text.  In general, the best reason for using
interactive IKSD access is that the IKSD (C-Kermit 7.0) might have
capabilities lacking from your Telnet/Kermit client.  For example, your
client might lack Kermit server-oriented commands like GET and REMOTE.  It
almost certainly lacks the flexible file-selection mechanisms of C-Kermit
7.0 unless it *is* C-Kermit 7.0.  So, for example, suppose you want to
get a group of files matching several different patterns with a particular
range of sizes and dates, except for a certain file you want excluded, 
and some of them are text and others are binary, and the text files should
have their character sets translated:
<p><pre>
  (/u/ivan/files/) IKSD&#62; <u>set file character-set hp-roman8</u>
  (/u/ivan/files/) IKSD&#62; <u>set transfer character-set latin1</u>
  (/u/ivan/files/) IKSD&#62; <u>set transfer mode automatic</u>
  (/u/ivan/files/) IKSD&#62; <u>msend /larger-than:10000 /smaller-than:20001 -</u>
   <u>/after:24-Dec-1998_0:00:00 /before:1-Jan-1999_0:00:00 -</u>
   <u>/except:c123.txt /recover c*.txt x*.zip *.tar.gz </u>
</pre><p>
<p>
To terminate an interactive IKSD session, type LOGOUT or EXIT at the IKSD
prompt.
<p>
(Note that at some sites, the IKSD might be configured to allow only
client/server mode.)

<p><hr><b><a name="swm">SWITCHING MODES</a></b><p>
[<a href="#dia">Next</a>] [<a href="#iia">Prev</a>] [<a href="#top">Top</a>]<p>

You can switch between client/server and interactive mode whenever you like.
To switch from client/server to interactive mode, give the following commands
to your client:
<p><pre>
  finish
  connect
</pre>
<p>
To switch from interactive to client server mode, give a SERVER command at the
IKSD prompt, then escape back to your client (or access its menus, etc).

<p><hr><b><a name="dia">DIALUP ACCESS</a></b><p>
[<a href="#ttc">Next</a>] [<a href="#swm">Prev</a>] [<a href="#top">Top</a>]<p>

A striking advantage of IKSD over a traditional FTP server is that IKSD can be
accessed by dialup as well as by Telnet connections.  This is possible when a
terminal server may be dialed that can make a Telnet connection to the host
where IKSD is running.  Just dial up the terminal server and ask it to make a
Telnet connection to port 1649 on the desired host.  Everything except tight
coupling (<a href="#ttc">next section</a>) works the same (but of course there
might be transparency problems, which can be handled in the normal ways --
SET PARITY, SET PREFIXING, etc).

<p><hr><b><a name="ttc">TIGHT COUPLING</a></b><p>
[<a href="#dia">Prev</a>] [<a href="#top">Top</a>]<p>

Tight coupling ensures that the Kermit client and Kermit server are always
ready to respond to each other using the proper command interface.  For
example, if the IKSD is in server mode and you give a CONNECT command to the
client, the IKSD presents its interactive prompt.  Conversely, if you give a
SERVER command at the IKSD prompt, the client will return to its own command
prompt or menu.  If you return to the local command prompt while the IKSD is
at its interactive prompt, then any subsequent server oriented commands (SEND,
GET, REMOTE ...) automatically put the IKSD into server mode.

<p>

Tight coupling relies on a new Kermit-specific Telnet protocol option.  Both
the Telnet client and Telnet server must implement the KERMIT option.  This
requires that Telnet be used end-to-end and prevents tight coupling on dialup
or multi-hop connections.

<p>

Tight coupling requires clients that implement the new protocols.  Presently
these include:
<p><ul>
<li><a href="https://kermitproject.org/ck70.html">C-Kermit 7.0</a>
<li>Kermit 95 1.1.19
