<title>Kermit FAQ - The Backspace Key</title>
</head><body>

<h2><i>My Backspace Key doesn't work!</i></b></h2>

<b><i>The short answer:</i></b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#termtype">Choose a terminal emulation that is supported by the host.</a>
<li><a href="#tellhost">Inform the host of this terminal type.</a>
</ul>
<p>
Then, if necessary:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#setkey">Make the emulator send what the host expects</a>, OR:
<li><a href="#stty">Make the host expect what the emulator sends.</a>
</ul>

<p>

<b><i>The long version:</i></b>

<p>

Terminal emulation lets you use your PC to make a connection to another
computer and interact with it as if your PC were a terminal, even though
your PC is not really a terminal and almost certainly does not have the
same kind of keyboard as the terminal it is emulating.

<p>

One of the most confusing aspects of terminal emulation is making the PC keys
do what their keytops say they do.  Many people find it quite surprising when
the Backspace key doesn't backspace, the Arrow keys don't move the cursor, the
Insert key doesn't insert, and so on.  In general only the letter and digit
keys on the main keypad can be depended upon to act as their labels suggest.
The rest, well...  each has its own story.  This is the story of the Backspace
key.

<p>
<ul>
<li><i>
This discussion applies mainly to PC-based versions of Kermit:
<a href="../k95.html">Kermit 95</a> and
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/mskermit.html">MS-DOS Kermit</a>,
which include full key-mapping capabilities.  <a
href="../ckermit.html">C-Kermit</a> for UNIX (including Linux, FreeBSD, AIX,
Solaris, HP-UX, etc) has a limited key-mapping feature that allows
backspace/delete configuration.  However, most of the discussion is general
information that should be useful regardless of connection method and
software.

</i>
<p>
<li><i>Terms like "left" and "right" are used in the
context of left-to-right writing systems like English, Russian, or Greek.  For
right-to-left scripts like Hebrew, the directionality is reversed.</i>
</ul>

<p>

First some terminology.  "Backspace" might (or might not) be the name of a
key.  For example, it is printed on the keytop of the large key at the upper
right of main keypad on the PC 101 keyboard.  On the DEC keyboard, the same
key is labeled with a symbol (<tt>&#60;X]</tt>) instead
of a word<b>.</b>&nbsp;  "Backspace" is also is the name of an ASCII control
character (ASCII value 8), which might or might not be associated with the
Backspace key.  "Backspace" is also an abstract concept relating to computers,
terminals, and typewriters, having at least two distinct meanings:

<p>

<ul>

<li>To erase the character left of the active position (cursor), and
simultaneously move the cursor to the position previously occupied by that
character.  This is called a <i>destructive backspace</i>.

<p>

<li>To move the cursor one space to the left into the same position as the
character that was previously to its left, without erasing that character.
This is a <i>nondestructive backspace</i>.  Nondestructive backspacing is
usually done with the Left Arrow key, discussed
<a href="../faq-c-arr.html#faq-c-arr">elsewhere</a>.

</ul>

<p>

To confuse matters even further, your keyboard might have keys other than
Backspace that suggest a destructive backspace capability.  For example, PC
keyboads include both a "Del" and "Delete" key and one or two Left Arrow keys
in <i>addition</i> to the Backspace key.  These are strictly for local PC
functions and not, in general, for sending characters to the host (but of
course in Kermit you can map them to do whatever you want).

<p>

To cause a <b>destructive backspace</b> operation, the terminal must send an
appropriate code to the host, and the host must reply with appropriate
terminal-specific codes to move the terminal's cursor and remove the unwanted
character.  Unfortunately, different hosts and applications use different
characters (or sequences) for destructive backspace (and of course, different
terminals use different codes for screen formatting).  The terminal emulator,
Kermit or otherwise, has no way of knowing what host or application you are
using, or how it is configured, and therefore no way of knowing what to send
when you press the Backspace key.

<p>

Of course, Kermit's Backspace key must send <i>something</i> &quot;out of the
box&quot;, i.e. in the absence of specific instructions from you.  This is
<i>default</i> backspace assignment.  Each emulation (VT100, Wyse 60,
Televideo, etc) has an appropriate default assignment, namely what the
corresponding key on the real terminal sends.

<p>

Therefore, it should be sufficient to inform the host you are connected to
about your terminal type, and then it should expect the destructive backspace
code that is associated with that terminal.  In practice, however, this is
rarely enough.  In <a href="#unix">Unix(*)</a>, for example,
the terminal driver has no connection with the terminal database, so
setting or changing your terminal type in Unix has no effect on the characters
it uses for destructive backspace (or other forms of editing, such as word
and line deletion).

<p>

For most emulations Kermit uses one of the two most
likely destructive backspace values, and in fact the one that is defined in
ASCII to be destructive backspace, in most cases Rubout (RUB), also known as
Delete (DEL), character number 127, which sometimes is displayed as
&quot;<tt>^?</tt>&quot;.  Lest anyone believe this is a frivolous choice, we
quote from American National Standard X3.4-1977, Section 5.1, Control
Characters:

<p>

<ul>
<li><b>0/8 BS (Backspace)</b>.  A one-active-position format effector that
moves the position backward on the same line.
<p>
<li><b>7/15 DEL (Delete)</b>.  Also known as RUB (Rubout).  A character used
primarily to erase or obliterate an erroneous or unwanted character...
</ul>
<p>

(Certain other emulations have their own defaults.  For example Data General
DASHER terminals use Control-Y for character deletion, because that is what
Data General operating systems such as AOS/VS expect.)

<p>

What happens if the wrong choice is made?  If Delete is chosen but is not the
host's destructive backspace character, it is likely to:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Interrupt or cancel the current command (default SIGINT in many Unixes).
<li>Be accepted as a data character and echo as "<tt>^?</tt>".
<li>Be ignored.
</ul>
<p>

If Backspace is chosen but is not the host's destructive backspace character,
it is likely to:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Move the cursor to the beginning of the current line (VMS).
<li>Perform a nondestructive backspace.
<li>Be accepted as a data character and echo as "<tt>^H</tt>".
<li>Enter "help mode" (EMACS).
<li>Recall the correct part of a failing command (TOPS-20).
</ul>

<p>

Even when the host terminal driver uses a specific character
such as Backspace for erasure, this does not guarantee that all applications
also use it.  One well-known case in point is EMACS, which -- in effect --
replaces the terminal driver with its own; in EMACS, control-characters are
used as commands: Ctrl-H for Help, Ctrl-B for (cursor) Back, Ctrl-F for
(cursor) Forward, etc.  If you find EMACS's key definitions disconcerting,
you can change them, e.g.:
<p>
<pre>
  (define-key global-map "\^h" 'backward-char)                 ; nondestructive
  (define-key global-map "\^h" 'backward-delete-char-untabify) ; destructive
</pre>

<b><a name="termtype">Select an Appropriate Terminal Emulation</a></b><p>

The first step in making your Backspace key behave as expected is to choose an
terminal emulation in Kermit that is appropriate for the computer your are
connecting to, and then (if necessary) tell your host what kind of terminal
Kermit is emulating.  The command for choosing a terminal emulation in Kermit
is:

<p>
<pre>
  SET TERMINAL TYPE <i>name</i>
</pre>
<p>
Type a question mark (<tt>?</tt>) in place of the <i>name</i> to get a list
of the available emulations.  Here are some examples:

<p>
<pre>
  <u><i>Host Operating System</i></u>        <u><i>Terminal Type(s)</i></u>
  (Open)VMS, RT11, RSX, ...    VT100, VT102, VT220, VT320
  Digital Unix, Tru64, Ultrix  VT100, VT102, VT220, VT320
  BBS's                        ANSI-BBS, AVATAR
  AOS/VS or DG/UX              D210, D215, D217, D463, D470
  Stratus VOS                  TVI950
  Linux                        LINIX
  SCO XENIX, OSR5, ODT, UNIX   SCOANSI
  Unixware                     AT386
  HP-UX                        HPTERM, HP2621A
  AIX                          AIXTERM, HFT, IBM3151
  SINIX                        SNI-97801, BA80
  BeOS                         BETERM
  QNX                          QNX, QANSI
  Most other UNIX              VT100 or VT102
  3270 protocol converters     VT100, IBM3151, Heath-19
</pre>

<p>

When the most appropriate emulation is not available, most hosts also
support VT100 and/or Wyse 50 or 60.

<p>

<hr>
<b><a name="tellhost">Inform the Host of Your Terminal Type</a></b><p>

The command for telling your host what terminal type you have depends on
the host operating system and, in the case of Unix, also on the shell.
Some examples (for the DEC VT100 terminal type):

<p>
<pre>
  set terminal /device vt100   <i>(VMS, manual)</i>
  set terminal /inquire        <i>(VMS, automatic)</i>
  term vt100                   <i>(Unix if it has a 'term' command)</i>
  export TERM=vt100            <i>(Unix ksh or bash)</i>
  setenv TERM vt100            <i>(Unix csh)</i>
  TERM=vt100 ; export TERM     <i>(Unix sh)</i>
</pre>

<p>

After that, if the Backspace key still does not work, you have <b>two
choices</b>:

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Change Kermit</b> to send what the host expects.
<li><b>Change the host</b> to expect what Kermit sends.
</ul>
<p>

Well, sometimes three choices.  If the Backspace key sends the DEL character
but the host wants the Backspace character, you can type Ctrl-H (hold down the
Ctrl key and press the "h" key) instead of using the Backspace key.

<p>
<hr>

<b><a name="setkey">Changing What Kermit's Backspace Key Sends</a></b><p>

Kermit's SET KEY command lets you redefine the Backspace key (or any other
key) to send whatever you want it to send (or to take any other actions).

<p>

The SET KEY command has two operands: a unique identifier for a key or key
combination, called a <i>keycode</i>, and the value or action to be assigned
to the key, called the <i>definition</i>:

<p>
<pre>
  set key <i>keycode</i> <i>definition</i>
</pre>
<p>

In Kermit commands, a keycode is a number preceded by a backslash.  Keycodes
are likely to be different for different operating systems, keyboards, and/or
Kermit programs.  In particular:

<p>
<pre>
  <u><i>Program</i>      </u>      <u><i>Keycode for Backspace Key</i></u>
  MS-DOS Kermit               \270
  Kermit 95                   \264
</pre>
<p>

(You can find out the keycode of any key or key combination by giving the
SHOW KEY command.  Kermit prompts you to press a key; you can press any key
or key combination and Kermit tells you the keycode.)

<p>

As noted above, the characters most commonly used by terminals to send a
destructive backspace command to a host computer are single ASCII <i>control
characters:</i> Delete and Backspace.  Control characters are entered into SET
KEY and other Kermit commands by their numeric ASCII value, preceded by
backslash (which tells Kermit that these are character codes, rather than
literal digits).  Here are the characters used for destructive backspace, in
decreasing order of likelihood (numbers are shown in decimal):

<p>
<pre>
  <u><i>Character Name</i>    </u>     <u><i>Alternative Name</i></u>    <u><i>ASCII value</i></u>
  Delete (DEL)             Rubout (RUB)           127
  Backspace (BS)           Control-H (^H)           8
  End of Medium (EM)       Control-Y (^Y)          25
  Number Sign (#)          Pound Sign              35
  Cancel Character (CCH)   <i>(7-bit)</i> ESC T        27 84 
  Cancel Character (CCH)   <i>(8-bit)</i>                148
</pre>
<p>
(Number sign was used on very old Unix systems that were accessed from
Teletype hardcopy terminals; this original Unix default is still found
here and there.  CCH is an 8-bit (C1) control character from ISO 6429,
which has a 7-bit coding as the sequence ESC followed by the letter T.)

<p>

Now let's put all this together to show the possible combinations:

<p>
<pre>
  <u><i>Action</i>              </u>     <u><i>Kermit 95</i>        </u>      <u><i>MS-DOS Kermit</i>    </u>
  Backspace sends DEL      set key \264 \127      set key \270 \127
  Backspace sends BS	   set key \264 \8  	  set key \270 \8
  Backspace sends EM	   set key \264 \25 	  set key \270 \25
  Backspace sends '#'	   set key \264 \35 	  set key \270 \35
  Backspace sends CCH	   set key \264 \148	  set key \270 \148
  Backspace sends ESC T	   set key \264 \27T	  set key \270 \27T
</pre>
<p>

Of course other arrangements are possible too.  Remember, you can assign
any definition you want to any key or key combination.  Some people might
prefer to have Backspace always send DEL and (say) Shift-Backspace or
Control-Backspace always send Ctrl-H (or vice versa).  Example for K95:

<p>
<pre>
  set key \264  \127      <i>(Kermit 95: Backspace sends DEL)</i>
  set key \1151 \8        <i>(Kermit 95: Ctrl-Backspace sends BS)</i>
</pre>

<p>

<i>Where do I put these commands?</i>  You can give SET KEY commands at the
Kermit prompt, or you can put them in your Kermit customization file:
<tt>MSCUSTOM.INI</tt> for MS-DOS Kermit; <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> for Kermit 95.

<p>

In Kermit 95, if you use the Dialer to make connections, you can also
choose the Backspace-key action for each connection on the Keyboard
page of the Dialer notebook for that connection.

<p>

<hr>
<b><a name="stty">Changing What the Host Expects</a></b><p>

In the days of real terminals, there was no way to change what a terminal's
Backspace (or equivalent) key sent.  Therefore host operating systems such
as <a href="#unix">Unix(*)</a> that did not require a certain kind of terminal
for access had to provide a method for adapting to different terminals.

<p>

Other host operating systems (such as VMS) always expect the same character
for destructive backspace and you can't change it; in the VMS case, you simply
have no choice but to configure your emulator to send DEL.

<p>

Unix hosts, however, let you change your editing and interruption characters
(and much else besides) with the <tt><i>stty</i></tt> command.  The
particulars of this command vary greatly from one Unix variety to another, so
you'll need to view the documentation by typing one of the following commands
at the Unix shell prompt:

<p>
<pre>
  man stty
  info stty
</pre>
<p>

Here are a few examples:

<p>
<pre>
  <u>Operating System</u>   <u>View Settings</u>    <u>Change to BS </u>     <u>Change to DEL  </u>
  Digital Unix 4.0   stty             stty erase ^h     stty erase "^?"
  HP-UX 8.00         stty             stty erase ^h     stty erase "^?"
  HP-UX 10.20        stty             stty erase ^h     stty erase ^?
  IRIX 6.5           stty -a          stty erase ^h     stty erase ^?
  Linux              stty -a          stty erase ^h     stty erase ^?
  SCO OSR5           stty             stty erase "^H"   stty erase "^?"
  SINIX 5.42         stty             stty erase "^h"   stty erase "^?"
  Solaris 2.5.1      stty -a          stty erase ^h     stty erase ^?
  SunOS 4.1          stty all         stty erase ^h     stty erase ^?
  Ultrix 4.3         stty all         stty erase ^h     stty erase "^?"
  Unixware 7.0       stty             stty erase ^h     stty erase ^?
</pre>
<p>
Quoting requirements might vary from shell to shell (sh, ksh, bash, tcsh, etc).
When in doubt use doublequotes as shown in many of the examples above.
Note that in all cases above, the "<tt>^</tt>" character is "circumflex"
or "caret", normally produced by typing Shift-6.  In other words, "<tt>^h</tt>"
in an stty command is circumflex followed by the letter "h", not Control-H
itself.   Also note that case might be significant in the control-character
letter name: "h" or "H".
