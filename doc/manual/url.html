<p>

Kermit 95 can activate your Web browser when you Ctrl-click on a Universal
Resource Locator (URL) in the Terminal or Command window, or when you give a
BROWSE command.  By default, URLs that K95 has recognized are highlighted;
you can Ctrl-click on any part of a highlighted URL.  You can also Ctrl-click
on text that K95 has not recognized as a URL, but which you believe your
browser can handle anyway, such as "short-form" URLs like www.ibm.com.

<p>

The default method for locating and activating the browser is as follows:

<p>
<ul>

<li>Windows:
The <tt>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\http\shell\open\command</tt> value from the Registry.
<p>
<li>OS/2:
Via path search for <tt>NETSCAPE.EXE</tt> or <tt>EXPLORE.EXE</tt>.
</ul>
<p>

You may override the default in the Dialer's <b>Options..Configure</b>
Applications dialog, or by specifing a browser as follows (normally in your
<tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> or <tt>K2CUSTOM.INI</tt> file):

<p>
<dl>

<dt><tt>SET BROWSER <i>[ filename [ command-line-options ] ]</i></tt>

<dd>Use this command to specify the name of your Web browser program, for
example:
<p><pre>
  set browser C:\Netscape\Navigator2\Program\Netscape.exe -h
</pre>
<p>

or (note the braces when the filename contains spaces):

<p>
<pre>
  set browser "C:\Program Files\iexplore.exe"
</pre>
<p>
</dl>

By default, <b>a new instance</b> of the browser is started each time you
perform a browse action (because K95 does not know the specific interface to
each version of each browser on each platform).

<p>

<tt>SHOW BROWSER</tt> displays the current browser.

<p>

K95's default method for choosing and invoking the browser was chosen because
it is the method that works "out of the box" for the most people.  Other
methods are described below that you might like better -- if they work!

<h3><a name="urlcmd"><hr>The BROWSE Command</h3>

<b>Links:</b> [<a href="#urlmouse">Next</a>] [<a href="#url">Index</a>]
<p>

<p><dl>
<dt><tt>BROWSE <i>text</i></tt>
<dd>Invokes your browser on the given text, for example:
<p><pre>
"browse http://www.kermit-project.org/".
</pre><p>
</dl>

Kermit 95 is suspended until the Browser exits (but see below).

<h3><a name="urlmouse"><hr>Clicking on URLs</h3>

<b>Links:</b>
[<a href="#urlhotkey">Next</a>]
[<a href="#urlcmd">Previous</a>]
[<a href="#url">Index</a>]
<p>

The <tt>\KmouseURL</tt> verb, which is assigned to Ctrl-Button-1 on your mouse
by default, is used to start your browser on the URL that you click on.  For
example, if the text:

<p><pre>
  http://www.kermit-project.org/
</pre><p>

appears in Kermit 95's Terminal or Command screen, and you move the mouse
pointer to anywhere within this text, then hold down the Ctrl key and click
button 1, Kermit starts your browser on this URL.

<p>

Practically any text is a valid URL for a browser.  For example, if you tell
your browser to visit "ibm", it might very well be clever enough to
try "<tt>http://www.ibm.com/</tt>" (the browser treats any text as a potential
URL, whereas K95 has to pick true, well-formed URLs out of arbitrary text
streams).

<p>

When you Ctrl-click on some text, K95 scans backwards and forwards from the
mouse point to determine the boundaries.  If the URL has wrapped, K95 does not
get the second half because it would have no way of telling the difference
between a URL that ended on the right screen margin from one that wrapped.
The result of this scan is passed as-is to the browser, except that if it
appears to be an email address, then "mailto:" is added to the front of it (if
not already there).

<p>

The result of the scan is also placed in the variable, <tt>\v(url)</tt>, in
case you want to check it or use it later.  If the URL ends with a period
followed by whitespace, K95 does not include the period, since URLs that
appear in email or news postings are likely to be at the end of a sentence,
and most URLs do not actually have a period at the end.

<p>

Note: You might find that some dexterity is required to click the mouse
without moving it.  If Ctrl-click on a URL doesn't seem to work, it's probably
because the mouse was in motion, and so Windows reported a drag event rather
than a click event (in which case, K95 executes whatever is associated
with Button 1 Ctrl-Drag, which is "Select text and transmit it" unless you
changed it).

<h3><a name="urlhotkey"><hr>URL Hot Keys</h3>

<b>Links:</b>
[<a href="#urldoit">Next</a>]
[<a href="#urlmouse">Previous</a>]
[<a href="#url">Index</a>]
<p>

The <tt>\Kurl</tt> verb lets you put the the terminal cursor on any URL and
then press the associated key to have your browser visit the URL.  Example:

<p><pre>
  K-95&#62; <u>set key \375 \Kurl</u>
</pre>

This makes F8 your URL hot key.  Then whenever the terminal window is active,
and you can place the terminal cursor on a URL (as you can, for example, in
a fullscreen text editor like EMACS, VI, or EDT), you can use this key to
go to the site.  Handy for mouse-ogynists.

<h3><a name="urldoit"><hr>Do-It-Yourself URL Hot Spots</h3>

<b>Links:</b>
[<a href="#urlsexe">Next</a>]
[<a href="#urlmouse">Previous</a>]
[<a href="#url">Index</a>]
<p>

You can use the following method to let you select any arbitrary text and pass
it to your browser.  Define a macro like the following in your K95CUSTOM.INI
file:

<p><pre>
  define URL {
      browse \v(select)
      if terminal-macro connect
  }
  set mouse button 1 alt drag \Kurl
</pre><p>

Now you can hold down the Alt key and select text with mouse button 1.  When
you release button 1, the selected text is passed to your defined browser.

<p>

Alternatively you can use "<tt>run start \v(select)</tt>" rather than
"<tt>browse ...</tt>"; the effect should be the same.

<h3><a name="urlsexe"><hr>The SE.EXE Program</h3>

[<a href="#url">Index</a>]
<p>

Windows 95 and NT include an API called <tt>ShellExecute()</tt>.  Given a
character string, this API <i>(a)</i> decides what application is appropriate
for it based on a Registry search, <i>(b)</i> checks to see if the application
is already running; and <i>(c)</i> if it is, sends a <a
href="gloss.htm#g_dde">DDE</a> message to the application telling it to
process the given string; otherwise it starts the application, giving it the
string as an operand.

<p>

So, for example, if the string is "<tt>oofa.xls</tt>", ShellExecute() might
determine that the appropriate application is Excel, checks to see if Excel is
running, and if so, sends a DDE message to it telling it load the
<tt>oofa.xls</tt> file; otherwise it starts Excel and loads it with
<tt>oofa.xls</tt>.  If the string is:

<p><pre>
  http://www.kermit-project.org/
</pre><p>

then the appropriate application is your primary Web browser.  For
"<tt>oofa.gif</tt>" it is your GIF file viewer (which might also be your Web
browser).  For "<tt>oofa.ps</tt>" it is your PostScript previewer, assuming
you have one registered.

<p>

Note that many applications do not respond to DDE messages; when such an
application is invoked via ShellExecute(), a new copy is always started.

<p>

A small program called <tt>SE.EXE</tt> is included for use with Windows 95 and
Windows NT.  It simply calls ShellExecute() on its argument.  For example:

<p><pre>
  se http://www.kermit-project.org/
</pre><p>

passes "<tt>http://www.kermit-project.org/</tt>" to ShellExecute(), which
should send your browser (starting it if necessary) to the Kermit website.
Similarly,

<p><pre>
  se oofa.txt
</pre><p>

should start your text editor (such as Notepad) on the <tt>oofa.txt</tt> file,
and so on.  But exactly what <i>really</i> happens depends on the filetype
associations in your Registrey (Windows only) and meny other factors.
If you give an argument to SE that it does not understand (i.e. for which
there is not an association in the Registry), it does nothing.

<p>

If you specify <tt>SE.EXE</tt> as your browser, it is the same as telling K-95
to "set browser" to your preferred browser, except:

<p>
<ol>

<li>This does not always start a new copy; if the browser is already running,
it simply visits the given URL as if you had brought your browser to the
front and did this yourself.

<p>

<li>If you click on something that is not a URL, this will start the
associated application, whatever it is; e.g. clicking on "readme.txt" 
will probably start a text editor.

</ol>
<p>

To choose <tt>SE.EXE</tt> as your browser:

<p><pre>
  SET BROWSER D:\K95\SE.EXE ; <i>(or whatever your Kermit 95 directory is.)</i>
</pre><p>

Equivalently, you can enter the pathname of <tt>SE.EXE</tt> in the Dialer's 
<b>Options..Configure Applications</b> dialog.

<p>

You can also use <tt>SE.EXE</tt> as your editor:

<p><pre>
  SET EDITOR D:\K95\SE.EXE  ; <i>(or whatever your Kermit 95 directory is.)</i>
</pre><p>

This lets Windows pick the appropriate editor for each type of file you
want to edit: plain text (<tt>.TXT</tt>), Windows Word (<tt>.DOC</tt>), C
language source code (<tt>.C</tt>), and so on, based on Registry entries.

<p>

And you can use <tt>SE.EXE</tt> in other ways too.  Suppose, for example, you
want to download a GIF (graphics) file from a Kermit server and view it as
soon as it arrives:

<p><pre>
  define gifget set file type binary, get \%1, se \%1
</pre><p>

In fact, this will work not only with GIF files, but any other kind of file
for which the Windows Registry contains associations.

<h3><a name="urlbuiltin"><hr>Using K-95's Built-In ShellExecute()</h3>

<b>Links:</b>
[<a href="#urlnetsc">Next</a>]
[<a href="#urlsexe">Previous</a>]
[<a href="#url">Index</a>]
<p>

In Windows, if you give the following command to Kermit 95:

<p><pre>
  SET BROWSER
</pre><p>

(by itself, no operands) this tells K-95 to call <tt>ShellExecute()</tt> on
any browse actions: the <tt>BROWSE</tt> command, or a <tt>\KmouseURL</tt>
event.  This is equivalent to:

<p><pre>
  SET BROWSER SE.EXE
</pre><p>

except that <tt>ShellExecute()</tt> is called from within K-95 itself, rather
than through an external program.  When this option works, it is to be
preferred because it does not cause the creation of any new windows, and it
does not force K-95 to suspend itself until SE completes, which could be
practically any amount of time.

<p>

Internal <tt>ShellExecute()</tt> would be K-95's default browser interface
except for the following hitches:

<p>
<ol>

<li><tt>ShellExecute()</tt> is not available in OS/2.

<li>It is dependent on the consistency of the Registry entries associated with
each URL.  Competing products from different vendors frequently cause errors
which prevent applications from being executed correctly.

</ol>
<p>

If "<tt>set browser</tt>" (with no argument, i.e. internal ShellExecute())
works for you, by all means use it, but run some tests on your system first to
be sure.  If it doesn't work, use "<tt>set browser se.exe</tt>" (which might
have the same problems, but at least they happen outside K-95), or "<tt>set
browser</tt>" to a specific browser program and its arguments.

<h3><a name="urlnetsc"><hr>Kermit 95 and Netscape Communicator</h3>

[<a href="#url">Index</a>]
<p>

Netscape Communicator, also known as Netscape 4.x, completely changed its
method for invoking its Telnet helper application, and so Kermit 95 1.1.13 and
earlier do not work with it (nor do any other Telnet programs that we know
about).  Earlier versions of Netscape would invoke the Telnet program using
the command-line you gave in its <b>Options..General preferences..Apps</b>
dialog.  with the IP name/address and possibly port appended to it, such as:

<p><pre>
  C:\K95\K95 -J xyzcorp.com 2000
</pre><p>

(where "<tt>C:\K95\K95 -J</tt>" is what you configured in Netscape, and
"<tt>xyzcorp.com 2000</tt>" are the hostname and port added to the command
line by Netscape to make the connection.

<p>

The Netscape 4.x substitutes some kind of bizarre pseudo-URL that
most Telnet applications do not understand for the simple hostname and port.
As of version 1.1.14, K95 is capable of parsing these misformatted hostnames.
The syntax accepted is:

<p><pre>
  <i>[protocol</i>:<i>[</i>:<i>][</i>//<i>][user[</i>:<i>password]</i>@<i>]]host[</i>:<i>port][</i>/<i>]</i>
</pre><p>

(where optional parts are enclosed in brackets).  This form, as well as the
three forms that were accepted originally:

<p><pre>
  <i>host</i>
  <i>host port</i>
  <i>host:port</i>
</pre><p>

can also be used in SET HOST or TELNET commands and passed on the command line
as arguments to "<tt>-j</tt>" or "<tt>-J</tt>".  The <i>password</i>, if
given, is ignored.

<h3><a name="urlmsie"><hr>Kermit 95 and Microsoft Internet Explorer</h3>

[<a href="#url">Index</a>]
<p>

Internet Explorer activates the telnet program that is configured in the
Windows 95 or NT registry.  There is no means within Internet Explorer to
set the Telnet client that you wish to use.  The Kermit 95 Registry Tool
(<tt>K95REGTL.EXE</tt>) may be used to configure K95 as your default Telnet
client.
