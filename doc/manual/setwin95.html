<h2>Kermit 95 SET WIN95 Commands</h2>

The SET WIN95 command is used mainly for allowing you to work around bugs
or limitations in Windows 95 and 98.

<p>
<dl>

<dt><b>SET WIN95 8.3-FILENAMES</b> <i>{</i> <b>ON, OFF</b> <i>}</i>

<dd>Default is OFF.  When ON, instructs K-95 to report all filenames using 8.3
notation instead of the normal long filenames; this applies also to built-in
variables such as <tt>\v(dir)</tt>, <tt>\v(inidir)</tt>, <tt>\v(home)</tt>,
etc.  8.3 (FAT) filenames do not contain spaces.  Thus WIN95 8.3-FILENAMES ON
is useful for coping with files or directories whose names contain spaces.

<p>

<dt><b>SET WIN95 ALT-GR</b> <i>{</i> <b>ON, OFF</b> <i>}</i>

<dd>Instructs K-95, when used on Windows 95 or 98, to interpret the Right Alt
key as the Alt-Gr key (used on many non-USA keyboards for entering accented
or non-Roman letters or other non-ASCII characters).  This is necessary to
work around the failure of Windows 9x to properly translate non-US keyboards.
Default is OFF.

<p>

<dt><b>SET WIN95 KEYBOARD-TRANSLATION</b> <i>character-set</i>

<dd>Tells K95 the character-set that Windows 95/98 is using to send keystrokes
to Kermit-95 via the keyboard input functions.  Default is Latin1-ISO.

<p>

<dt><b>SET WIN95 LUCIDA-SUBSTITUTIONS</b> <i>{</i> <b>ON, OFF</b> <i>}</i>

<dd>Tells K95 whether or not to perform substitutions appropriate for
characters known to be missing from the Lucida Console font.  Default is ON.

<p>

<dt><b>SET WIN95 OVERLAPPED-IO</b> <i>{</i> <b>ON</b> <i>requests</i>, <b>OFF</b> <i>}</i>

<dd>Tells K95 whether to use Overlapped-I/O methods for reading
from and writing to serial and TAPI communication devices.  <i>requests</i>
specifies the number of simultaneous write requests that may be
overlapped, from 1 to 5.  Default is ON 3.

<p>

<dt><b>SET WIN95 POPUPS</b> <i>{</i> <b>ON, OFF</b> <i>}</i>

<dd>Tells K-95 whether to use Popups to query the user for
necessary information such as user IDs or passwords.  Default is ON, in which
case popups overlay the command screen, similar to Alt-H help popups in
appearance, and with the same coloration.  When OFF, automatically generated
prompts are done with ordinary lines of text.

<p>

<dt><b>SET WIN95 SELECT-BUG</b> <i>{</i> <b>ON, OFF</b> <i>}</i>

<dd>Some TCP/IP (Winsock) implementations for Windows have a defective
<tt>select()</tt> function.  Use this command to avoid the use of
<tt>select()</tt> if K95 appears to be unable to send data over a TCP/IP
connection.  Default is OFF.
