The Cyrillic character sets known to Kermit 95 are:
<p><pre>
  <i>Kermit Name    Type   Description</i>
   CYRILLIC-ISO  8-bit    <a href="gloss.html#g_iso">ISO</a> 8859-5 Latin/Cyrillic, also called "New KOI8"
   KOI8          8-bit    USSR Standard GOST 19768-76 ("Old KOI8")
   KOI8R         8-bit    A new version of KOI used in Russia
   KOI8U         8-bit    A new version of KOI used in the Ukraine
   KOI7          7-bit    <a href="gloss.html#g_ascii">ASCII</a> with lowercase letters replaced by Cyrillic
   CP855         8-bit    Cyrillic PC Code Page
   BULGARIA-PC   8-bit    Cyrillic PC Code Page used in Bulgaria
   CP866         8-bit    Cyrillic PC Code Page used in former Soviet Union
   CP1251        8-bit    Cyrillic Code Page for Windows
</pre>

<p>

KOI8 is (or was) the character set most widely used in newsgroups and email,
but KOI8R and KOI8U are becoming more popular since the breakup of the
Soviet Union.  CP1251 is sometimes seen in newsgroups -- its encoding is
partly the same as ISO Latin/Cyrillic, partly different, plus it includes
some graphic characters in the C1 control area.

<p>

ISO Latin/Cyrilic, CP855, and CP1251 include the Cyrillic letters needed for
modern Belorussian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian, and Ukrainian.
KOI8U includes the characters needed for Ukrainian.  The others contain only
the Cyrillic characters used in modern Russian orthography.  KOI-7 contains
only uppercase Roman and Cyrillic letters.

<h3 id="cyrterm">Cyrillic Terminal Emulation</h3>

Kermit 95 can be used to display Cyrillic text from the host if you have a
Cyrillic font or code page on your PC, but the conditions under which you may
send Cyrillic letters from your keyboard depend on the specific operating
system.

<h4>Windows 95/98/ME</h4>

In Windows 9x and ME, Cyrillic terminal is possible if you have a
Cyrillic code page, CP855, BULGARIA-PC (known in Bulgaria itself, erroneously,
as CP856), or CP866 loaded on your PC.  However, it is
not likely that you have one of these code pages, or can have it, unless you
have installed a Cyrillic version of Windows; see the 
<a href="k95bugs.html">Kermit 95 Bug List</a> for more
information about this.  As noted, BULGARIA-PC and CP866 are sufficient only
for modern Russian; CP855, though not widely used, includes the additional
characters needed for Ukrainian, Belorussian, etc.

<h4>Windows NT/2000/XP</h4>

The Windows NT family, unlike Windows 9x/NT, supports Unicode in a Console
window.  You should be using Lucida Console as your font, in which case you'll
always have Cyrillic terminal emulation available.  Lucida Console also has a
wider selection of Cyrillic letters, at least the full repertoire of ISO
8859-5, which, as noted, is sufficient for Bulgarian, Byelorussian,
Macedonian, Serbocroatian, and Ukrainian, as well as Russian, and possibly
also pre-1918 Russian and maybe other, more archaic forms.

<p>

Also unlike Windows 9x/ME, Windows NT/2000/XP allows the application to set
the Code Page to be used for delivering keystrokes.  The code page may be set
in Kermit 95 with the:

<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE <i>code-page</i>
</pre><p>

command.  <i>code-page</i> could be replaced with either CP866 or CP1251 or any
other code page available on your system.  Use SHOW CHARACTER-SETS to view
a list of available code pages.

<p>

The SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET command must be used to set the local
character-set to the code page that was set with SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE.
Otherwise, keyboard to host translation will not properly work.

<h4>OS/2</h4>

The OS/2 version of Kermit 95 comes with a Cyrillic "PC font" equivalent to
Code Page 866, that you can load if you don't have a Russian version of OS/2.
You can use this in fullscreen sessions only -- NOT in an OS/2 Window, and
even then it works only if your video driver allows it.  In Kermit/2, the
command:

<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE 866
</pre><p>

actually attempts to load the Cyrillic CP866 font into your video adapter
(this can't be done in Windows 95 or Windows 98).

<h3 id="cyrcfg">Configuring K95 for Cyrillic Terminal Emulation</h3>

Use the following commands to enable Cyrillic terminal emulation in Kermit 95:
<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL TYPE VT220     ; (or other desired terminal type)
  SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET { CP855, BULGARIA-PC, CP866, CP1251 }
  SET TERMINAL REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET -
   { CYRILLIC-ISO, KOI8, KOI8R, KOI8R, SHORT-KOI, CP855, CP856, CP866, CP1251 }
  SET TERMINAL BYTESIZE 8     ; Not needed for Short-KOI
</pre><p>
Check your Kermit 95 character-set selection with SHOW CHARACTER-SETS.
<p>
<h4>The Local Character Set (Windows 95/98 Only)</h4>
<p>
At the DOS prompt, type "CHCP" to see what Windows think your Console
Code page is.  If it reports CP866 or BULGARIA-PC correctly, then you don't
need to give a SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET, since Kermit 95 will find this
out by itself.  Otherwise, tell Kermit to:
<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET CP866 ; (or CP855, or CP866)
</pre><p>
to let K95 know what the Console window is using, since in this case Windows
will not report it correctly to Kermit.  You should only specify the one that
is actually used in your Console window.  Windows does not give Kermit any
ability to change it.
<p>
<h4>The Remote Character Set</h4>

Choose the remote character set that is appropriate for the host or service
you are connecting to.  If you are using an 8-bit remote character set
(i.e. any Cyrillic set except SHORT-KOI), you must also make sure that the
remote host and the connection itself are set up for 8 data bits, no parity.
Examples:
<p><pre>
  stty pass8               <i>(Some UNIX)</i>
  stty -parenb             <i>(Some other UNIX)</i>
  stty -evenp -oddp        <i>(Maybe another UNIX)</i>
  stty cs8                 <i>(Another UNIX)</i>
  stty -istrip             <i>(And another UNIX)</i>
  char/on/8bt              <i>(AOS/VS)</i>
  set terminal /eightbit   <i>(VMS)</i>
</pre><p>
Some of the UNIX stty options might need to be used in combination, e.g.:
<p><pre>
  stty cs8 -istrip         (for example, on HP-UX 10.20)
</pre><p>
If you are going through a terminal server or other intermediate device, it
too might need to be commanded into 8-bit transparency.

<h3 id="cyrkey">Entering Cyrillic Characters on the Keyboard</h3>

In Windows, it is possible to install more than one
keyboard layout in the Keyboard Control Panel on the Input Locales
page.  When more than one Input Locale/Layout combination is defined,
you are required to choose one of them as the default, and to choose a
key combination (such as Left Alt + Shift) to switch among them.  This
is called the Switch-Locale key sequence.  The default Input-Locale is
the Input-Locale that each Window uses when it is opened.
<p>
For instance, it is possible to install:
<p><pre>
  Input Locale                                  Layout
  ------------------------------------------    ---------------
  English (United States)                       US
  Russian                                       Russian
</pre><p>
with "English (United States)" as the default input locale and a
Switch-Locale key sequence of "Left_Alt+Shift".  Since the keyboard
only has one alphabet on it, this "alphabet shift" key is needed to
switch between the two defined alphabets.  In Russian Windows, for
example, it is necessary to type Roman letters when you type Windows
file names or Kermit 95 commands and Cyrillic letters when writing in
the Russian language.
<p>
Although the behavior is supposed to be the same on Windows 95/98/ME and
Windows NT/2000/XP, it turns out that it is not.

<h4>Keyboard Shifting in Windows NT/2000/XP</h4>

In Windows NT/2000/XP, you can give the following commands to Kermit 95:
<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE 1251
  SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET CP1251
  SET TERMINAL REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET CP866
</pre><p>

When the current locale is "English (United States)" K95 receives
Roman characters from the keyboard.  When the current locale is
"Russian" K95 receives Cyrillic characters from the keyboard.  To
toggle between the two, press the Switch-Locale key sequence.
<p>
When issuing commands to K95 switch to the "English" locale and when
sending Cyrillic characters to the host switch to the "Russian"
locale.  There is no limitation to mixing Roman and Cyrillic
characters via this method at the K95 command prompt or in terminal
mode.
<p>
Note that only characters that are in the active code page may be
delivered to K95 from the keyboard.  In the above example code page
1251 is used because it is available on all versions of NT, and it
contains all of the Roman characters needed for U.S. English and the
Cyrillic characters used by CP866.  (CP866 is not available on the
U.S. version of NT but may be available on some international
versions.)

<h4>Windows 95/98/ME</h4>

When using Windows 9x/ME, locale switching does not work
properly in 32-bit console applications so Kermit 95 has to simulate
the switching of keyboard layouts.  The Russian Windows 95 uses
CP866 as its default code page for the DOS and Windows-32 Console
environments.  Therefore, both Roman and Cyrillic characters are
available for display.
<p>
<p>
For 16-bit DOS applications the current locale is ignored.  All keystrokes
generate Roman letters regardless of what locales are installed.
<p>
In Windows 9x, both Left Alt-Shift and Ctrl-Shift are "hotkeys" that
toggle the Keyboard Input-Locale among those installed.  When K95
is started it uses the Default Input-Locale as set in the 
Keyboard Control Panel, and then you can change to another input locale
with the hotkeys.
<p>
When K95 starts it will auto-detect CP866 as the code page and configure
the Local Character-set to the same value.

<h3 id="cyrkbmode">Using Kermit 95's Russian Keyboard Mode</h3>

If you have a font with Cyrillic characters, but lack
a Cyrillic keyboard and driver, you
can use Kermit 95's built-in Russian keyboard mode
(it is called "Russian" because only the letters of the modern Russian
alphabet are handled, due to lack of knowledge about where to put other
Cyrillic letters such as Dje, Gje, Lje, Kje, Kze, Nje, I, Yi, Je, Ie, Tshe,
etc -- or for that matter, lack of enough keys on Roman keyboards to
accommodate them):

<p>
<ul>
<li>The <tt>\KkbRussian</tt> verb controls Russian keyboard mode.  By default,
it is assigned to Ctrl-Alt-Shift-R but it may be assigned to any other key or
key combination.  It switches the main keypad into Russian mode (see keymap
below).  When the keyboard is in Russian mode, the terminal type in the status
line has "-R" appended to it, for example "VT220-R".
<p>
<li>The <tt>\KkbEnglish</tt> verb to switch the main keypad back to English
mode.  The <tt>\KkbRussian</tt> verb can do this too, since it acts as an
on/off switch.
<p>
<li>Russian keyboard mode is cleared when you execute the <tt>\Kreset</tt>
(reset terminal) function, which is assigned to Alt-r by default.
</ul><p>
Of course, you can assign these verbs to any other keys of your choice:
<p><pre>
  SET TERM KEY RUSSIAN \368 \KkbRussian  ; F1 enters Russian keyboard mode
  SET TERM KEY ENGLISH \369 \KkbEnglish  ; F2 enters English keyboard mode
</pre> <p>
The default Cyrillic key layout follows the one used by Microsoft Russian DOS
and throughout the former USSR.  The names of the Cyrillic letters are from
the ISO 8859-5 Standard.  The following table shows the key assignments when
the keyboard is in Russian mode.  If you do not like them, you can use the SET
TERMINAL KEY command (new to Kermit 95 1.1.8) to create your own layout.  The
"code" is the CP866 value, which applies no matter what the remote terminal
character set is (Kermit will translate).

On Belorussian keyboards, upper and lowercase letter shcha is replaced by
upper and lowercase Cyrillic letter I (the one that looks just like a Roman I,
not the one that looks like a reverse Roman N).  This letter does not exist
in code page 866, but you can substitute Roman letter I if desired.
<p>
<dt><i>Note 2:</i>
<dd>
On Belorussian keyboards, upper and lowercase hard sign is replaced
by upper and lowercase Belorussian letter Short U:
<p><pre>
  SET TERM KEY RUSSIAN  \93 \247  ; Map ] to lowercase Short u
  SET TERM KEY RUSSIAN \125 \246  ; Map } to uppercase Short U
</pre> <p>
On Ukrainian keyboards, these same keys are mapped to Ukrainian letter Yi
(looks like Roman I with two dots instead of one):
<p><pre>
  SET TERM KEY RUSSIAN  \93 \244  ; Map ] to lowercase yi
  SET TERM KEY RUSSIAN \125 \245  ; Map } to uppercase Yi
</pre> <p> 
See Table VIII-6 in <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite> pp.470-473 for complete Cyrillic
character-set listings for ISO 8859-5, CP866, KOI-8, and Short KOI.

<p>


To define your own Cyrillic key map, create a file containing the desired
<tt>SET TERM KEY RUSSIAN</tt> commands, in which the assigned values are CP866
values.  <tt>TAKE</tt> this file (or enter its name in the Dialer entry,
Keyboard page, Key map "Read from File" box), and then whenever you execute the
<tt>\KkbRussian</tt> verb, your keyboard will have the mappings defined in
this file.
