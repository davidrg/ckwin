<p>
This file lists bugs or other problems in Kermit 95 and its operating
environment.  There is a lot of information here, organized chronologically,
and so it is recommended you use a text editor or Web browser to do
case-insensitive searches for keywords to turn up what you are looking for.
<p>
Bugs that have been fixed are listed here by number and name, but, except for
the bugs that were fixed since version 1.1.16, the descriptions of fixed
bugs have been moved to a <a href="k95fixes.html">separate file</a>.
<p>
If you do not have the current version of Kermit 95, please upgrade to it:

</pre>
<p>
if you are experiencing bugs or problems, they might already be fixed.  Also,
the BUGS.TXT / BUGS.HTM file that comes with the current release will have a
more up-to-date list of bugs and hints than an older copy.  If you do have the
current version of K95, also consult:

<dl><dt><b>BUG CATEGORY</b>
<dd><tt>(M) </tt><b>Microsoft</b> Windows bug.<br>
<tt>(I) </tt>An <b>IBM</b> OS/2 bug.<br>
<tt>(X) </tt>A <b>feature that is disabled</b> in Kermit 95 because of
an operating-system bug.<br>
<tt>(Z) </tt>A bug in the <d>Dialer</b> caused by a bug in the GUI
development system that was used to build it.<br>
<tt>(V) </tt>Bug or restriction in <b>vendor code</b>, e.g. in 3rd-party
TCP/IP stacks.<br>
<tt>(K) </tt>A <b>Kermit 95</b> limitation or bug.<br>
<tt>(D) </tt>A <b>documentation</b> error.<br>
<tt>(C) </tt>A hardware / System / Drivers <b>Configuration</b> problem.<br>
<tt>( ) </tt>Not a bug.
</dl>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The February 1996 Service Pack from Microsoft did NOT fix any of
the bugs in the M and X categories.  The September 1996 OEM SR2 release
fixed at least one of these bugs
(<a href="#b79">Bug #79</a>) but is not available as a patch
to earlier releases.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Windows NT 4.0 for Intel shipped with a dangerous but
little-known bug that can randomly corrupt your data.  Microsoft has fixed the
problem in Service Pack 1 for Windows NT 4.0.  It is strongly recommended
that users of Windows NT 4.0 download and install this and all later fixes.

<h2><a name="descriptions">BUG DESCRIPTIONS</a></h2>

<h3><a name="b1">1. Ctrl-C Interruption in Command Screen</a></h3>

Ctrl-C typed in the Command screen to interrupt a command is not always
delivered to Kermit 95 by Windows, due to a bug in Windows 95 and Windows NT:
Microsoft PSS ID Numbers Q130717 and Q134284, 09-25-1995.
<p>
Once Ctrl-C fails to be delivered, it might never be delivered again.
Workaround: evidently the only workaround is to restart Windows.  In the
meantime, you can still send Ctrl-C in the Kermit 95 Terminal screen using
Ctrl-Shift-C (or any other key to which you use SET KEY to map <tt>\3</tt>).
<p>
If you use Ctrl-C to interrupt a file transfer that has not yet started, there
may be a delay of several seconds before the Ctrl-C takes effect (this one is
fixed in 1.1.2).
<p>
In some cases, even when Ctrl-C is ignored, however, you might still be able
to use Ctrl-Break for the same purpose.

<h3><a name="b2">2. Video Attributes vs Terminal Screen Size in Windows 95</a></h3>

A workaround was discovered for the the Windows 95 bug that prevented K95 from
using screen widths other than 80 or heights other than 25, 43, or 50.  As of
version 1.1.12, screens of any reasonable height and width can be used in
Windows 95 as well as Windows NT.  OS/2 Warp 3.0 and earlier still restrict
console windows to 80 columns, but Warp 4.0 can use 132 columns.
<p>
Note, however, that Windows 95 video drivers are optimized for 80x(25,43,50);
other sizes work correctly as of K95 1.1.12, but might work slowly or exhibit
annoying amounts of flicker.  This is a Windows 95 feature.

<h3><a name="b3">3. Microsoft Telephony (TAPI)</a></h3>

TAPI support was added in K95 1.1.12, and is documented in the current
edition of the K95 manual.

<h3><a name="b4">4. Registration</a></h3>

Kermit 95's registration procedure currently consists of customizing the
<tt>K95.EXE</tt> and <tt>K95DIAL.EXE</tt> programs with your name, company,
and serial number, and mailing back your registration card with one of your
Kermit 95 serial number stickers affixed to it.  Future plans include online
registration.

<p>

In 1.1, registration was applied only to the <tt>K95.EXE</tt> file.  Beginning
with 1.1.1 it was extended also to the Dialer.

<h3><a name="b5">5. Changing Code Pages</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> This item applies to Windows.  In OS/2, loading code pages or
"PC fonts" into a full-screen session is not only permitted, but also safe --
provided the video driver allows it; evidently, however, the trend in new
video drivers is not to allow it -- thus preventing Kermit 95's Hebrew and
Cyrillic support from working as widely as it used to.  See Section 3.4 of
OS2K95.TXT.
<p>
<b>NOTE 2:</b> As of version 1.1.8, this section applies only to Windows 9x.
The Windows NT version of Kermit 95 now uses Unicode fonts rather than
PC code pages.
</blockquote>
<p>
As noted in the Kermit 95 manual, Windows 95/98 does not support code page
switching.  The idea is that if you are going to use code pages, you should
use only one.  But that's bad because some people really do need to work in
different languages; for example, English, Icelandic, Hebrew, and Russian.
Kermit 95 supports all of these very nicely as long as the underlying code
page is installed.  Presumably if you are running Windows 95 in Iceland, your
code page is 850; in Poland it is 852; in Israel it is 862; in Russia it is
866; in Greece it is 869.  So if you have the code page you need, no worries.
But if you need to work in (say) both Russian and Hebrew, you need a way to
switch code pages.
<p>

To change code pages, you can get a utility from Microsoft called CHANGECP.
It is on the Windows 95 CDROM, in the <tt>Other\Changecp</tt> folder.  It
comes with lots of code pages, including 862 (Hebrew) and 866 (Russian).  Its
menu only lists a few of them, but you can try typing any one you want on the
command line; for example:

<p><pre>
  changecp 850
</pre><p>
or:
<p><pre>
  changecp 866
</pre><p>
And then rebooting your system.  You can't change code pages on the fly in
Windows 95 as you can in DOS.  Nor is there any way to load fonts into a
DOS window of Windows 95 (such as the LOADFONT program we use with MS-DOS
Kermit to provide code-page switching).
<p>
Maybe CHANGECP will work for you, maybe not.  When we tried it, 850 worked,
866 did not, even though all the supporting files for CP 866 were included.
The supporting files for Hebrew CP 862 are not even there, so this one didn't
even have a chance.
<p>
When you run CHANGECP, it prints a scary error message warning of possible
disk corruption.  This means that if you use accented or special characters in
filenames (or for that matter, in the files themselves), the appearance of
those characters can change if you change code pages.  If CHANGECP does not
work for you, our best advice is to give up -- do not try editing the Registry
or any other workaround, as this is almost certain to end in tears.
<p>
If a code page can be loaded, Kermit 95 can use it.  But it seems that the
only way you can have a "non-Latin1" code page loaded is to install the
appropriate national version of Windows 95 -- such as Hebrew, Russian, Czech,
Ukrainian, Polish, etc.
<p>
If you want better language support in Windows 95 console applications,
express your wishes to Microsoft.
<p>

<b>NOTE:</b> You can use the DOS LOADFONT program together with the "PC fonts"
that are distributed with MS-DOS Kermit to load Cyrillic, Hebrew, and other
code pages into full-screen Windows sessions, BUT this tends to cause Windows
(not Kermit, but Windows) to crash, so this practice is not recommended,
encouraged, or supported.  The true fix to this situation will come in the
conversion of K95 to full GUI, when it will no longer have to use code pages.
(As of version 1.1.8, the Windows NT console version uses a Unicode font, so
it can display any characters that are in its font -- e.g. Lucida Console.)

<h3><a name="b6">6. Keyboard Scan Codes and Caps Lock</a></h3>

Certain keyboard scan codes, constructed by Kermit 95 from information
reported by Windows, are inconsistent between Windows NT and Windows 95.
These include Num Lock and Numeric Keypad /.
<p>
The Caps Lock bug is
<a href="k95fixes.html#b6">fixed in 1.1.5</a>.  For dead keys, see items
<a href="#b103">103</a>-<a href="#b104">104</a>.
<p>
Also see items <a href="#b283">283</a> and <a href="#b386">386</a>.
<p>
No problems in OS/2.

<h3><a name="b7">7. "Kermit 95" Keyboard Verb table</a></h3>

In the "Kermit 95" manual, Appendix I, Table I-5, pages 80-81, in the
"Assignment" column, all occurrences of "Ctrl-\" are incorrect and should be
replaced by "Ctrl-]", which is Kermit 95's default escape character.
Also, there are many new keyboard verbs, listed in KEYMAPS\KVERBS.TXT; the
default assignments are listed in KEYMAPS\DEFAULT.INI, and you can use the
new SAVE KEYMAP command to save your current configuration into a file.
<p>
As of version 1.1.14, the HELP KVERB command can be used to find out what 
a particular kverb does and which key it is assigned to.

<h3><a name="b8">8. PUSH and related commands do not work in Windows NT 3.50</a></h3>

The Windows NT <tt>CMD.EXE</tt> shell bug that causes this problem is fixed in
Windows NT Workstation 3.51.  This bug does not occur with replacement shells
such as JP Software's <tt>4NT.EXE</tt>.

<h3><a name="b9">9. Don't Use the Auto Font Setting in Windows 95</a></h3>

It's best to pick a specific size.  When the setting is left at Auto,
sometimes the window will mysteriously and inexcplicably change size,
typically when returning to the Command screen from a non-standard-size
Terminal screen, often becoming a tiny small-print window.  This also tends to
happen (but doesn't always) (in Windows 95 only) when you pick any size other
than 24 x 80 for a terminal screen on the Terminal page of the Dialer.
<p>
Starting with K95 1.1.12, the first version to support true 132-column screens
in Windows 95, a font size of Auto in the Console version can cause Windows 95
(original version) to create ever-smaller screens when switching back and forth
between 80- and 132-column mode, eventually resulting in alert boxes or
crashes.  This is a Windows 95 bug, not a Kermit one.  When this happens while
TAPI is in use, the modem will become unusable until Windows 95 is rebooted.
<p>
Choose a specific font size, not "Auto".  See the instructions in the READ.ME
file creating a shortcut.  You can choose your preferred font size in the
K95.PIF file that you create when following those instructions.  (As noted
there, the default font size for console windows is set by editing the
Properties of <tt>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\CONAGENT.EXE</tt>).

<i>(<a href="k95fixes.html#b10">Fixed</a>.)</i>

<h3><a name="b11">11. Missing Features</a></h3>

As of K95 1.1.19, no features are missing that are supposed to be present.
Of course many features remain to be added in future releases.

<h3><a name="b12">12. Hardware / System / Drivers Configuration</a></h3>

The behavior of Kermit 95 or any other program that uses serial ports will be
unpredictable if there are hardware conflicts.  Typical symptoms include
application or system freeze-ups, general protection faults, etc.  This is a
result of the PC architecture, which has a severely limited number of device
interrupts, but which is often overloaded with devices.
<p>
Serial communication devices must have unique addresses and IRQs (Interrupt
numbers).  You can't have more than one device using the same IRQ.  If you do,
neither device is likely to work -- or worse.  Unfortunately, many devices
(such as network boards) are often shipped set to the same IRQ (3 or 4) that
is used by a serial port.
<p>
Serial ports COM3 and COM4 (or higher) are always problematic, since these are
not part of the standard PC architecture and there are no slots for them in
the PC BIOS.  COM3 and COM4 are generally set by their manufacturers to use
IRQ 3 or 4, which conflict with COM1 or COM2.  To resolve the conflict, you
must either find a free IRQ and set your COM3 or COM4 device to use it (and
tell Windows about it), or else disable one or more of the conflicting
devices.  Changing the IRQ is risky because the new one you pick is likely to
conflict with something else, especially in a well-equipped PC (CDROM, sound
card, network adapter, etc).
<p>
In Windows 95, a COM port is supposed to be recognized automatically when you
install it.  However, Windows might easily make incorrect assumptions about
its address or IRQ, or whether it has a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer.  You
can examine these, and correct them if necessary, in My Computer -> System ->
Device Manager -> Ports -> Advanced.  In Windows NT, Control Panel -> Ports ->
Advanced.
<p>
Even when your configuration is conflict-free, you will experience data loss
-- often severe -- on serial connections if your serial-port controllers are
not "buffered": 16550A UARTs must be used, rather than lower-numbered models.
Unfortunately, many PCs are furnished with unbuffered UARTs by their
manufacturers as a cost-cutting measure.  You can find out what kind of UARTs
you have on which COM ports, on which addresses, using which IRQs, in the
Windows dialogs mentioned above.
<p>
Steer clear of any modem that says "RPI" or "Controllerless" or "Winmodem" on
the box.  Read the small print carefully.  These are not fully functional
modems, and are very likely not to work adequately, or at all, under Windows
NT or OS/2.  Although they are designed for Windows 95, they might not work
well there either, and even if they do, they might impose an unacceptable load
on your system, since the full job of the modem is being done by the PC CPU,
and/or they might interfere with your sound card.  (Note: nowadays, most new
PCs come with Winmodems preinstalled -- the only way to avoid them is to
buy a second, external, modem and attach it to your COM1 or COM2 device.)
<p>
Another type of problem occurs whenever you use certain software that installs
its own drivers (such as COMM.DRV, the Windows 95 communications port driver)
over the real one.  Such drivers are intended specifically for use with the
software they came with, and will often fail to work with other software.
Unfortunately, there is often no notification when a standard driver is
replaced in this manner, and also there is often no easy way to undo the
change.  You can find out about your communications driver in the modem
diagnostics, Driver button.  The communications port driver that comes with
the first release of Windows 95 is identified there as:
<p>
  COMM.DRV, 5856 bytes, 7/11/1995 09:50AM
<p>
(the date and time display might vary with time zone).
<p>
Problems that are even more subtle and vexing can result from any of the
drivers you have installed on your PC -- SCSI-board drivers, sound-card
drivers, CD ROMs, etc.  Sometimes the problems are solved by obtaining a newer
version of the driver from the board vendor.  Other times, the only recourse
is to purchase an entirely different board and driver.
<p>
Even more ominous are problems with the PC BIOS.  PC makers often have BIOS
upgrades available, perhaps downloadable from their BBS's or Web sites.
<p>
Also, owners of laptop and "green" PCs should watch out for the untoward
effects of power savers and suspend/resume features on internal modems,
PCMCIA cards, and similar hardware.
<p>
Finally, beware of any system changes that you make.  In Windows, do not use
the Registry editor (REGEDIT) unless (a) you know what you are doing, and (b)
you have a way to back out of any changes.  A seemingly innocent change in the
Registry can have unpredictable ramifications later on, causing Kermit 95 and
all your other applications, and Windows itself, to misbehave or malfunction.
In some cases the only recourse is to reformat your hard disk and reinstall
Windows 95 from the original media.

<h3><a name="b13">13. Miscellaneous Dialer Peculiarities</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>The Hangup button does not interrupt dialing.  If you need to interrupt
dialing, bring the Kermit 95 Command window to the front and type Ctrl-C.
<p>
<li>Other items from this entry are
<a href="k95fixes.html#b13">fixed</a>.
</ul>

<h3><a name="b14">14. Miscellaneous Hints and Tips</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>The Terminal screen can become frozen under certain circumstances; for
   example, receipt of an unterminated escape sequence (perhaps caused by
   noise).  When this happens, the Terminal screen will report OSC, APC,
   DCS, etc, in the status line.  To unfreeze, use Alt-R (Reset) while in
   the terminal screen.  This is not a bug -- it is how real VT 220 and
   higher terminals work.
<p>
<li>If you try to download a file directly to the printer by naming the file
   "PRN", this will fail unless you "set file collision overwrite".  That's
   because Kermit's normal action when receiving a file is create a backup
   copy -- but it can't make a backup copy of the printer :-)  Similarly for
   other files whose names are the same as those of DOS devices: LPT1, AUX,
   COM2, and so on.
<p>
<li>The printer driver might fail to print the last or only page.  This is a
   traditional shortcoming of PC operating systems.  Sometimes the page can
   be forced out by using Alt-E (verb \KprintFF) to send a formfeed to the
   printer, or by sending another print job, to the printer.  Some printers
   (such as the HP4L and HP5L) have a special button that ejects the page.
   K95 1.1.14 and later offer additional printer controls, such as
   the /END-OF-JOB switch, documented in the current K95 manual.
</ul>

<h3><a name="b15">15. Debugging Tips</a></h3>

You can save the configuration for a particular Dialer entry into a plain-text
file by highlighting the entry, then going to File on the main menu and
choosing Generate Script File.  The script file goes into Kermit 95's SCRIPTS
subdirectory and has the same name as the highlighted Dialer entry, but with
spaces and special characters converted to underscores.  It is a plain-text
file composed of Kermit commands that can be easily faxed or e-mailed to our
tech-support staff.
<p>
You can troubleshoot connection problems by following the instructions in
Chapter 3-6 of <a href="ckb2.html"><cite>Using C-Kermit</cite></a>, second
edition.  You can obtain transcripts and logs of troublesome connections using
"log session" and also with "set dial display on" and then using your mouse to
copy and paste the modem dialog from the screen into a file.
<p>
You can troubleshoot terminal emulation problems by putting the terminal
screen into debug mode (with Alt-D when the terminal screen is active).
<p>
You can troubleshoot file-transfer problems by following the instructions in
<a href="https://www.kermitproject.org/onlinebooks/uck2ep2.pdf#page=207">
Chapter 10 of <cite>Using C-Kermit</cite></a> (second edition).  File-transfer
packet logs are obtained with the "log packets" command.
<p>
The ultimate debugging tool is the debug log, obtained with "log debug".
It tends to grow huge rather quickly.
<p>
Any or all of these logs can be sent to our tech support staff for analysis
in cases where suggested remedies or workarounds are ineffective.
<p>
Version 1.1.14 and later allow the session.log and debug.log files to be
activated in the Dialer entry.

<h3><a name="b27">27. Screen updates updates are slow on some PCs</a></h3>
<p>
Kermit 95 is necessarily less snappy than MS-DOS Kermit (under DOS) on the
same type of PC because MS-DOS Kermit is in direct control of the
communications and the video, whereas Kermit 95 must go through several
layers of drivers and operating-system calls to do the same thing.
<p>
Video drivers vary in speed.  Those in Windows NT tend to be significantly
slower than those in Windows 95.  Even in Windows 95, some drivers or
hardware might be slower than Kermit 95 was designed for.  Kermit 95's
default screen-updating cycle is 100 milliseconds (1/10 second); if your
video driver is slower than that, you might be able to make Kermit go faster
by increasing (yes, increasing) its screen-update interval, for example:
<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL SCREEN-UPDATE FAST 200
</pre><p>
Flickering can occur when the video driver is not performing a comparison
between what is already on the screen and what it is being asked to write.
So it paints the entire window (which takes time) even when it doesn't have
to.  When acceleration is on (and supported by the driver) minimal screen
paints occur and screen updates should be fast.  In the Control Panel either
on the Display object or the System Object, there is a performance page which
allows you to set the Video Acceleration properties.  Make sure this is set
to use full acceleration.  The only flickering you should see in this case is
the mouse pointer, since it is turned off and on before and after each
console screen paint.
<p>
If that doesn't help, you can experiment with Kermit 95's SET TERMINAL
SCREEN-UPDATE FAST and SMOOTH options to choose which algorithm is used to
update the screen when new data arrives from the host.  Whenever a byte
arrives from the host it is processed by an incoming data thread.  If it would
result in a screen write, an internal screen buffer is updated and a flag is
set.  When using the FAST algorithm, the screen buffer is copied to the
physical screen (if the flag is set) on a timer thereby allowing the maximum
data throughput from the host to occur regardless of the speed of the video
drivers.  This is the default screen updating method.
<p>
The negative aspect of this method is that on really fast connections it is
possible for some screen writes to never make it to the screen, e.g. during
continuous scrolling (but the data is processed correctly, and can be viewed
in the scrollback buffer).  The SMOOTH option says to copy the screen buffer
to the window whenever the dirty flag is set.  This results in much slower
data handling, and a potentially significant increase in the number of screen
writes, but on the other hand it tends to make echoing snappier when you are
typing.  Also see item <a href="#b469">469</a>.

In Windows 95, but not Windows NT or OS/2, if a REMOTE HOST command is sent to
a Kermit 95 server, the server will lock up.  Diagnosis: The server end of
REMOTE HOST commands is implemented by running the corresponding operating
system command with its standard output piped back to the server; redirection
of standard output in Windows 95 can cause the parent process to get stuck in
a read that never returns (refer to Microsoft Knowledge Base Article Q150956).
<p>
Partially fixed in version 1.1.3, by using temporary files rather than pipes.
<p>
Partially fixed even more in 1.1.5 by recoding REMOTE DIRECTORY, REMOTE
DELETE, etc, not to call the Windows shell, but to do everything internally.
So now, hopefully, the problem occurs only with REMOTE HOST commands, if at
all.
<p>
Fixed even more in 1.1.16 by changing the handle used by K95 for accessing
the console device.

<h3><a name="b47">47. Kermit 95 file naming conventions in conflict with Windows</a></h3>

(Also see item <a href="#b177">177</a>.)
<p>
Kermit initialization and key mapping files historically have a filetype
(extension) of .INI, but these are different from Windows .INI files.
<p>
Kermit online plain-text documentation have historically been had the .DOC
filetype, but Windows thinks these are Word documents.  In Kermit 95 1.1.11,
all *.DOC files were renamed to *.TXT.
<p>
Similarly, Kermit script program files have long had a filetype of .SCR, but
in Windows 95, .SCR files are associated with screen savers.  Thus if you
double click on a Kermit .SCR file, you are likely to get an undesired
result.
<p>
In Kermit 95 1.1.3, all script files distributed with Kermit 95 were renamed
from *.SCR to *.KSC, and all references to them (e.g. in the many Dialer
pages) were changed accordingly, and the new script files that were included
with this release for host mode were also given the .KSC extension.  The .INI
files, however, were not renamed.  Kermit has been around a lot longer than
Windows!

<h3><a name="b79">79. PCMCIA or Plug-and-Play Modem Problems</a></h3>
<p>
The Microsoft VCOMM driver used in Windows 95 versions prior to OEM SR2 for
serial port services in console windows does not support Plug-n-Play.
Therefore, 32-bit communication programs such as Kermit 95 can not use these
modems in Windows 95 unless they are previously initialized by another
program, such as Hyperterminal or Dial Up Networking.
<p>
Version 1.1.10 of Kermit comes with a new utility, K95CINIT, to initialize
such modems so they can be used by Kermit 95.  This program needs to be run
only once each time you boot Windows 95.  You can run it "by hand" at any time
before starting Kermit 95, or you can put put in your StartUp Menu to make it
run automatically each time you restart Windows.
<p>
Version 1.1.12 supports TAPI and so should work with any modem or other TAPI
device at all; K95CINIT is not needed in K95 1.1.12 or later unless you want
to use a Plug-n-Play COM-port device directly that Kermit can not normally see
on its own as a COM port, rather than through TAPI.

<h3><a name="b80">80. RLOGIN vs FTP Software OnNet-32 (V).</a></h3>

K95's RLOGIN connections seem not to work at all with FTP Software OnNet-32.
To enable them, you have to edit the ONNET32\ETC\SERVICES file and comment out
the definitions of "login" service on port 49.  The port that works is 513.
Now you can make RLOGIN connections, but certain RLOGIN features, such as
automatic screen-resize notification, do not work because OnNet-32 fails to
properly deliver RLOGIN protocol messages as out-of-band data to K95.  The
same code works fine with Microsoft and OS/2 TCP/IP.
<p>
You can also specify the port number (not name) in RLOGIN commands to Kermit:
<p><pre>
  rlogin hostname:513 <i>[ userid ]</i>
</pre><p>
This allows you to make RLOGIN connections without editing the SERVICES file.

<h3><a name="b81">81. "set host 0" vs FTP Software OnNet-32</a></h3>

An IP address of 0 can sometimes be used to indicate one's own IP host.
Using this construction in K95 with OnNet-32, however, causes K95 to crash.
Diagnosis: Bug in OnNet-32.  Workaround: Don't "set host 0" or "telnet 0"
in OnNet-32.

<h3><a name="b82">82. Kermit 95 and Digital UNIX 3.2</a></h3>

Digital UNIX 3.2 (OSF/1 3.2) seems to think your terminal has one more line
than it really has and so "man", "more", and similar commands try to use
Kermit's status line for screen data.  Workarounds -- either:
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Tell UNIX "stty rows 23" (one less than Kermit's screen length), or:
<li>Tell Kermit "set term height 25".
<li>Tell Kermit "set term statusline off" (1.1.5) to let UNIX use the
bottom line.
</ol>
<p>
It is not known whether Digital UNIX 4.0 behaves differently.

<h3><a name="b83">83. Extraneous characters on terminal screen in Windows 95</a></h3>

On certain PCs, when the system load is high and/or when memory, swapping, or
other resources are low, Windows's screen painting algorithm sometimes misses
the fact that some areas of the screen need to be updated.  Diagnosis: Bug in
Windows 95 CONAGENT.EXE, which tries to optimize screen painting by comparing
old and new window contents.  Sometimes it misses.  Workaround: Use Alt-Enter
to switch between window and full screen will temporarily clear up the
problem.  Also, rolling back and then forwards will also tend to force the
screen updates to be applied correctly.  Workaround: adjust the video
optimization using Control Panel -> System -> Performance, or adjust the
resolution or color depth to reduce CPU requirements.  Cure: Must be fixed by
Microsoft.  Also see Bug <a href="#b238">238</a>.

<h3><a name="b100">100. Kermit 95 for Windows requires long filenames</a></h3>
<p>
One file name in the Kermit 95 distribution, K95CUSTOM.INI, exceeds the 8.3
FAT name format.  This is not a problem in Windows 95, but it is bad news in
Windows NT when long filenames are disabled (by editing the registry) -- the
installation procedure fails.  Even if the industrious user finds a way to
complete the installation, the temporary files created by the Dialer (based on
the Dialer entry names, many of which are quite long) will cause runtime
failures.  So, at least for the present, maybe forever, this is a restriction.
Kermit 95 can not be installed on file systems restricted to 8.3 notation.

<h3><a name="b101">101. Host-controlled status lines</a></h3>

VT320 and Wyse host-controlled status line features are not fully implemented.
This will come with the GUI release.  However, in version 1.1.5 it is possible
to remove Kermit's status line from the screen, making it available to the
host; this satisfies the requirements of many host-resident programs for an
extra status line.  (The command is SET TERMINAL STATUSLINE OFF.)
<p>
Version 1.1.8 adds full support for the VT320 status line (and for user
messages on the Wyse models and Televideo label lines).

<h3><a name="b102">102. Wyse screen-transmit functions not implemented</a></h3>

This capability was added in version 1.1.8, but only if you enable it first
with SET TERMINAL SEND-DATA ON.  Use at your own risk -- host-initiated
screen transmissions are a notorious security loophole.

<h3><a name="b103">103. Windows 95 Dead key and Caps Lock bugs are fixed! (mostly)</a></h3>

(This entry applies only to Windows 95)
<p>
The bugs noted in Entry 6 regarding dead keys and Caps Lock should be mostly
fixed in version 1.1.5 by doing an end-run around the buggy Windows 95 console
agent(*), and adding our own substitute keyboard handling in its place.  The
fix is not perfect, however, because the "raw" keyboard driver is still hidden
from us, and the information we do receive is partially corrupted by Windows.
<p>
On the positive side, the Caps Lock bug is gone, and dead keys seem to work
correctly on US systems when the "international" keyboard driver is selected,
which uses dead keys, as well as on real German, Finnish, and other West
European Windows 95 systems, where it is also reported that the special
single-stroke keys (such as Umlauts on the German keyboard) work correctly.
The the terminal emulation and character-sets sections of the current K95
manual for details.
<p>
On the negative side, the fix interferes with the Alt-Gr key which, on most
non-USA keyboards, is used to select the "third" (or lower right, or front)
character printed on the keytop.  Alt-Gr is normally the right Alt key, and it
is really just a shorthand for Ctrl-Alt.  Thus, for example, on the German
keyboard, Alt-Gr-q produces at-sign (@), and so does Ctrl-Alt-q.  To work
around this side effect, you can either use Ctrl-Alt instead of Alt-Gr, or
you can give this command to Kermit 95:
<p><pre>
  SET WIN95 ALT-GR ON
</pre><p>
This tells Kermit 95 to treat the right Alt key as if it were Ctrl-Alt.
If SET WIN95 ALT-GR ON produces other unwanted and unanticipated side effects,
set it back OFF and use Ctrl-Alt instead.
<p>
SET WIN95 ALT-GR ON enables the use of Alt-Gr as a SHIFT key (i.e. to be held
down at the same time as the key it is modifying, just like Shift, Alt, or
Ctrl).  Kermit 95 does not support the use of Alt-Gr as a "prefix" or "sticky
shift" key (to be pressed and released prior to pressing the modified key).
<p>
Also, our workaround has moved some Control keys.  For example, Ctrl-\
(ASCII 28, Field Separator) which is normally sent by Ctrl-sz (Ess-Zet) on a
German keyboard (top left of 0 in digits rank), or Ctrl-] (ASCII 29), normally
sent by Ctrl-9, are now sent from their original positions on the US keyboard.
If you want to change these back to their expected positions, use SET KEY.
<p>
Of course, under Windows NT, dead keys, special keys, and Alt-Gr work
naturally and correctly (without any workarounds in the Kermit code), except
that some NT users report a beep whenever a dead key is pressed (even though
the correct dead-key combinations are still produced).
<p>
All of these problems will disappear when the GUI version is released and
Kermit is no longer accessing any of the bug-ridden Windows console services.
<p>
(*) Microsoft PSS ID Q140456, 12-07-1995:  "Deadkeys cannot be accepted as
input to a Windows 95 Console application even when the appropriate keyboard
layout is selected.  <tt>ReadConsoleInput()</tt> cannot read deadkeys in
Windows 95".
<p>
NOTE: Alt-Gr and Dead-key handling were broken again during the translation to
Unicode in 1.1.8 and was fixed and improved in 1.1.14.  As of 1.1.14, K95
should properly default the SET WIN95 ALT-GR command for most keyboard
layouts.  8-bit characters should now be properly translated for all locales
from the ANSI code page to the OEM code page used by the Windows Console
environment.

<h3><a name="b104">104. East European keyboard features might not work in Windows 95</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> This item applies only to Windows 9x. Since the release of version

</blockquote>
<p>
Testing of version 1.1.5 on East European Windows 95 versions was limited to
the Czech version.  Results are unknown for Polish, Hungarian, Romanian,
and other East European versions.  If you have problems entering East-European
(Latin2) characters, first make sure you have:
<p><pre>
  set terminal character-set latin2 cp852
  set terminal byte 8
</pre><p>
If SHOW terminal doesn't say your code page 852, then also:
<p>
  set win95 keyboard latin2
<p>
and, as noted in item <a href="#b103">103</a>:
<p><pre>

</pre><p>
In the Terminal Window, you can also enter East-European characters using
Kermit 95's Latin-2 Compose-key feature, documented in the current manual.
As of 1.1.14, SET WIN95 KEYBOARD-TRANSLATION is no longer needed.  Translation
from ANSI code pages to OEM code pages is performed using Win32 API calls.

There are all sorts of bugs in Windows 95 regarding support of console

applications (like Netscape).  One of many typical symptoms is loss of
keyboard focus.  One simple workaround (not guaranteed, but seems to work in
many cases) is to have Netscape start the Kermit 95 <tt>TELNET.EXE</tt>, which
in turn starts <tt>K95.EXE</tt>; thus <tt>K95.EXE</tt> is not being started by
a GUI application, and therefore this bug MIGHT not be tickled.  If that
doesn't work, try making a PIF file for <tt>K95.EXE</tt> and then having
Netscape run the PIF file, rather than the EXE.

<p>
Kermit 95 for OS/2 includes a SOCKS4 interface, described in
the <a href="os2k95.html">Kermit 95 for OS/2</a> notes.
<p>
The Windows version does not.  Firewall support needs to be built into the
TCP/IP stack, or the network itself (e.g. in a router or transparent bridge),
not each application.  Microsoft Winsock, for example, does not support the
SOCKS firewall negotiation mechanism, but Trumpet Winsock and FTP OnNet-32 do
support it.
<p>
The Microsoft Catapult proxy server announced in July 1996, however,
is supposed to provide transparent firewall support, both CERN and RWS (Remote
WinSock) styles, to all Windows applications, and so should work with K95.
<p>
And from NEC, we have a new 32-bit version of SocksCap, which sits between
Windows Sockets (WinSock) and the application (Kermit 95, Netscape, etc).  Its
authors have tested it successfully with 32-bit Microsoft WinSock on both
Windows 95 and NT using many different applications.  It should work with
SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 servers.  You can find SocksCap at:

numeric keypad, while Num Lock is on, and then letting go of the Alt key, is
supposed to return the character whose code value was typed.  This is supposed
to be a way of typing special characters that can't be typed any other way on
your keyboard.  Kermit 95, however, sees each key as you press it.  Thus,
Alt-<123> returns three scan codes -- Alt-Keypad-End, Alt-Keypad-Downarrow,
and Alt-Keypad-PgDn -- rather than the single character whose code value is
123.  If you need to type a character that is not available on any key, use
SET KEY to define a key to the desired code, e.g. when using Code page 437 to
assign lowercase letter i with grave accent to Ctrl-Shift-Equals:
<p><pre>
  set key \1979 \161
</pre><p>
This works in the Terminal window and, as of version 1.1.5, also in the
command window.  As of K95 1.1.16, you can also use SET TERMINAL KEY /LITERAL
to enter a literal definition, i.e. one that will not be translated.

<h3><a name="b133">133. Interruption keys are ignored during XYZMODEM transfers</a></h3>

Interruption of X-, Y-, and ZMODEM transfers by typing X, Z, E, etc, when the
file transfer screen is active, is not implemented yet.  Interrupting with
Ctrl-C works, but it leaves the other XYZMODEM program in protocol mode; to
take it out of protocol mode, you have to get back in the terminal window and
type five (5) Ctrl-X characters in a row.  In version 1.1.6, the other ZMODEM
program should exit automatically when you Ctrl-C Kermit 95, so the five
Ctrl-X's should not be needed.

<h3><a name="b134">134. Tone dialing changes to Pulse after first digit</a></h3>

Some modems have a feature called adaptive dialing.  When they are told to
dial a number using Tone dialing, they check to make sure that dialtone has
gone away after dialing the first digit.  If it has not, the modem assumes the
phone line does not accept Tone dialing and so switches to Pulse.
<p>
When dialing out from a PBX, there is almost always a secondary dialtone.
Typically you take the phone off-hook, get the PBX dialtone, dial "9" to get
an outside line, and then get the phone company's dialtone.  In a situation
like this, you need to tell the modem to expect the secondary dialtone.  On
Hayes and compatible modems, this is done by putting a "W" in the dial string
at the appropriate place.  For example, to dial 9 for an outside line, and
then 7654321, use ATDT9W7654321.  In Kermit 95, this is accomplished with:
<p>
  SET DIAL PBX-OUTSIDE-PREFIX 9W
<p>
(replace "9" with whatever your PBX's outside-line prefix is).

<h3><a name="b141">141. Control keys on national keyboards in Windows 95</a></h3>

As noted in <a href="#b103">Bug 103</a>, the fixes that were added to work
around the problems with Caps Lock and dead keys in the Microsoft console
agent might cause some of the control keys to "move" on national keyboards,
such as the German ones, from the position indicated by the keytop label to
the US-keyboard position.  Reportedly, this is nothing unique to Kermit; it
also happens with other communications software too, including Microsoft's own
Telnet and Hyperterminal.  Here is a sample key mapping file to put the
control keys back where they belong on a German keyboard, courtesy of Josef

with the addition of up- and down-arrow keys (or Ctrl-B and Ctrl-N) for
command recall.  Restriction.

<h3><a name="b148">148. The DIRECTORY and TYPE commands are too slow</a></h3>

The DIRECTORY and TYPE commands are built in to get around Windows 95 bugs
with pipes and process control.  If you would rather have Windows or OS/2
produce directory listings or type your files, then use "run dir" or "run
type" or "run more", etc.  In that case, you can also include Windows or OS/2
shell command switches.  But watch out for loss of keyboard focus and other
problems that can occur when you run inferior processes this way, especially
if you interrupt them with Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Break.

Several users have reported that the command screen loses messages or becomes
scrambled after giving a DIAL command, or two DIAL commands, or an ANSWER
command followed by a DIAL command, or after interrupting a DIAL command with
Ctrl-C.  Similarly, if you interrupt a file transfer with Ctrl-C and then
start another one, the screen is not fully repainted.  This problem started
happening in version 1.1.5 when we switched the command screen to use the
same virtual screen management that used by the terminal screen, to allow
scrollback, etc.  The cause is probably related to
<a href="#b83">Bug 83</a> above, which is
evidently exacerbated when an asynchronous process-related interrupt (like
Ctrl-C) occurs.  If this happens to you in the file-transfer display screen,
use Ctrl-L to refresh (or at least partially refresh) the screen.

<h3><a name="b177">177. The Dialer database can be corrupted by other applications (M).</a></h3>

Several Kermit 95 users have reported that the K95 Dialer suddenly and
mysteriously stopped working.  Diagnosis:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Kermit 95 Dialer database files (DIALER.DAT, DIALUSR.DAT, DIALINF.DAT) have
an extension or filetype (the part of the filename after the period) of DAT
(not unreasonable; people have been using DAT for data files for decades).
<p>
<li>Certain other applications, when you install them, register themselves in
the Windows Registry as the application for all files having the .DAT
extension.  These applications include at least ACT! (from Symantec) and
Wordperfect 7 (from Corel).
<p>
<li>The Kermit 95 Dialer database files now appear with the icon of the other
application.  Should you click on one of these icons, the other application
will be started and fed the K95 database file, and will likely damage it.
If that happens, the Dialer might be unusable from that point on.
</ul>
<p>
There is nothing Kermit can do to prevent this.  There is no mechanism for
arbitration of conflicting file associations.  If filetype XYZ is associated
with application A and then you install a new application, B, it might undo
application A's association and take over its files (or, conversely, it might
find that its files belong application A).  This is intrinsic to the design of
Windows 95 and NT.  Only one application can be the default application for
each filetype.
<p>
To defend against this effect, make a backup copy of your *.DAT files prior to
installing any new application, preferably on a diskette, which you should
remove immediately and put in a safe place.  And then remember to avoid
clicking on any of the files in your Kermit 95 directory, except of course the
EXE files, no matter what interesting icons they might display. (This warning
really applies to ALL your applications, not just to Kermit 95 -- never click
on a data file's icon if the icon does not seem appropriate.)
<p>
As of version 1.1.7, the Dialer keeps two backup copies of each .DAT file
as changes are made.

<h3><a name="b203">203. Dialer startup is slow</a></h3>

Startup of the K95 Dialer is unavoidably slow because it makes backup copies
of all of its database files every time it starts.  The backup copies go into
your PC's temporary directories (identified by the TEMP or TMP environment
variable).  The speed of startup depends on the speed of the disk that is used
and the sizes of the database files.  If you don't need all the predefined
BBS and Telnet site entries, etc, see the READ.ME file for instructions on
removing them.

the main Dialer window by stretching it with the mouse.  In version 1.1.14
the ScriptFile button was renamed to ShortCut because now it creates a
clickable shortcut on your desktop and/or in your Start menu.

<h3><a name="b215">215. Why does Dialup Networking pop up whenever I make a Telnet connection?</a></h3>

(Windows only) "Every time I start K95 to make a Telnet connection, the
dialup networking program is launched automatically.  I have to cancel it
first and then continue logging in."  This is not a Kermit problem -- the
same thing would happen with any Internet application, such as Microsoft
Telnet or FTP.  To fix: open your Windows 95 Dial Up Networking folder
(should be in your "My Computer" folder), go to Connections->Settings->
General and choose "Don't prompt to use Dial-Up Networking".
<p>
If that doesn't work and you are using Windows 95b (OSR2), check the setting
for "auto connect" in the Internet Control Panel.

<h3><a name="b216">216. Why does the termimal status line say "Script:" instead of "Prompt:"?</a></h3>

"Why does the status line say Script instead of Prompt sometimes?"  It says
this when CONNECT mode was entered from a script (command file or macro)
rather than from the prompt; thus escaping back from CONNECT mode will
continue the script (if there are any commands left in it), rather than
returning directly to the prompt.

<h3><a name="b217">217. Why is my login prompt missing?</a></h3>

There are two likely explanations for missing login prompts:
<p>
First, it can happen because Kermit 95 sent your user ID in advance.  This
happens on Rlogin connections and (in 1.1.8 and later) also on TELNET
connections if the Telnet sever supports the NEW-ENVIRONMENT protocol and
Kermit 95's LOGIN USER variable is set to match your username on the host.
Just enter your password, or defeat this feature with SET LOGIN USER to
nothing.
<p>
Second, this can happen when TELNET terminal-type negotiations cause K95 to
change its terminal type (and therefore to clear the screen); use K95's SET
TELNET TERMINAL-TYPE command to supply a terminal name acceptable to the host
and to suppress automatic terminal-type switching.
<p>
In version 1.1.16, this also happens when you make a connection authenticated
by Kerberos or SRP, in which case even the Password: prompt would be missing.

You can override the

environment variable) must contain the full pathname of the editor program,
such as C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\EDIT.COM.  Also, the "netedit" process, especially
when host-initiated, results in a lot of screen flashing as K95 switches back
and forth between its command screen, file-transfer display screen, and
terminal screen.  It can't be avoided.  Also see item <a href="#b268">268</a>.
<p>
NOTE: In version 1.1.12 and later, the full pathname of the editor is not
required if the editor program is in the PATH.

<h3><a name="b238">238. Keystrokes might be transmitted out of order in Windows 95</a></h3>

In an interrupt driven system such as Windows 95, Windows NT, UNIX, etc, the
keyboard driver is called to handle each event as it occurs.  When the system
is under heavy load, the events cannot be processed in real time and are
placed on an event queue.  In Windows 95, <tt>CONAGENT.EXE</tt> has a bug that
causes the event queue to be processed in last-in-first-out rather than the
expected first-in-first-out order.  Thus fast typists might occasionally see
their keystrokes transmitted in reverse order.  And (you guessed it) this does
not happen in Windows NT or OS/2.

<h3><a name="b239">239. Conflicts with CompuServe, AOL, etc</a></h3>

If you have installed Compuserve, America OnLine, or any other browser
package from an Internet Service Provider that uses its own proprietary
Sockets Library, there is a good chance that your existing Winsock
applications (including, but not limited to, Kermit 95) will no longer work.
<p>
This happens when the installation either replaces the Windows version of
WINSOCK.DLL and/or WSOCK32.DLL or adds new versions in a new directory.
While all Winsocks are supposed to implement the same API, they don't always
implement the same set of features or have the same bugs.  Therefore,
applications like K95 that make rather full use of Winsock might not work
properly with these replacement DLLs.
<p>
These applications and service providers should not be replacing the standard
Windows TCP/IP drivers.  This is an extremely reckless act and all bets are
off once they have done it.  If you are affected by an application that has
changed Windows' TCP/IP stack, contact the vendor of that application for a
way to safely back out of the installation.

<i>(<a href="k95fixes.html#b252">Fixed</a>.)</i>

<h3><a name="b253">253. HINT: Using SCOANSI emulation with SCO hosts</a></h3>

There is a type of terminal emulation commonly called ANSI, which is used by
BBS's.  It is very simple -- essentially nothing more than what you get with
ANSI.SYS on a DOS PC.  Then there is the highly evolved and complex version of
it used on the SCO (and Unixware) console.  Kermit 95 supports both; the first
emulation is called ANSI; the second is called SCOANSI.  However, the *name*
SCOANSI is unknown on SCO systems (SCO Xenix, SCO UNIX, ODT, and Openserver
versions 5.0.4 and earlier, and Unixware versions prior to 7.0), where it is
called simply ANSI.  So if a Telnet client such as Kermit 95 comes in
announcing its terminal type as SCOANSI, the SCO host doesn't recognize it.
In Kermit 95 1.1.8 and later, the Telnet terminal-type negotiation feature
will cause Kermit 95 to change to another terminal type, most likely "plain
old" ANSI.  To work around this problem in Kermit 95:
<p><pre>
  set terminal type scoansi
  set telnet terminal-type ansi
  set terminal character-set transparent
</pre><p>
Or on the SCO system (Reference: SCO Technical Article 109521, 17 July 1998):
<p><pre>
  # vi /etc/termcap (on the pre - 5.0.5 system)
</pre><p>

Find the line that reads:

<p><pre>
  li|ansi|ansi80x25|Ansi standard crt:\
</pre><p>

and change it to read:

<p><pre>
  li|ansi|scoansi|ansi80x25|Ansi standard crt:\
</pre><p>

Then type:

<p><pre>
   # vi /usr/lib/terminfo/terminfo.src
</pre><p>

Find the line that reads:

<p><pre>
  ansi|ansic|ansi-437|ansi80x25|Ansi standard console,
</pre><p>

and change it to read:

<p><pre>
  ansi|ansic|ansi-437|ansi80x25|scoansi|Ansi standard console,
</pre><p>

After adding the scoansi definition to the <tt>terminfo.src</tt> file, run
the terminal info compiler:

<p><pre>
  # tic <i>(no relink/reboot necessary)</i>
</pre><p>

SCO has added "scoansi" as an official terminal type (or, more precisely, a
preinstalled synonym for what it now calls "ansi") in OpenServer 5.0.5 and
Unixware 7.0.

<h3><a name="b254">254. Environment variables are not case sensitive</a></h3>

It has been noted that the \$(xxx) construction for accessing environment
variables is not case sensitive, as it should be.  This is a bug or a feature
of Windows 95 inherited from DOS (Kermit gives the environment variable name
literally to Windows, but Windows ignores the case of the letters).


<h3><a name="b255">255. Data loss in dialup host mode</a></h3>

When running K95 host mode in Windows 95 (but not NT or OS/2), callers could
experience fractured screens, lost or duplicated data, etc.  The problem was
traced to problems in Windows 95 overlapped serial i/o, so the HOSTMDM.KSC
script was modified to not use it in K95 1.1.12.  Similarly, keystrokes sent
to the hostmode screen could be lost if they were too close together.  This
was caused by a bug in HOST.KSC, also fixed in 1.1.12.

<h3><a name="b256">256. Problems with automatic login from certain Dialer entries</a></h3>

If you specify a password on the login page of a Dialer entry and find that
the connection is not made at all, try removing the password (and specifying
NONE for the prompt).  If that fixes the problem, but you still want to
specify a password (even though it is a security risk to store passwords on
your computer), then try changing the password on the host computer (e.g. by
appending an X to it) and entering the new password into the Dialer entry.
<p>
As of 1.1.14 you can also ask that the Dialer prompt you for the password
each time you want to connect to the host.
<p>
The problem is fixed in version 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b261">261. EXPLANATION: Changes in the operation of the numeric keypad</a></h3>

In VT220 and VT320 emulation, the PC's numeric keypad is mapped by default
to the VT terminal's numeric keypad.  Prior to version 1.1.10, however, this
was not true for VT100 and VT102.  But the numeric keypad functions are just
as important in VT100/102 emulation as they are in VT220/320, and a lot of
users of VT100/102 emulation complained that the numeric keypad didn't work
right.  So in version 1.1.10, the VT100/102 numeric keypad was mapped the
same as the VT220/320 numeric keypad.
<p>
However, this change (like all changes) surprised other people who had become
accustomed to the previous VT100/102 mapping, which was the same as the
mapping for the editing and arrow keys with the same labels.
<p>
If you want to restore the previous mapping, add the following to your
K95CUSTOM.INI file:
<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \290 \Kdnscn
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \291 \Kendscn
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \292 \Khomscn
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \293 \Klfarr
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \294 \Kuparr
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \295 \Krtarr
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \296 \Kdnarr
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \302 \{127}
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \400 \Kignore
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \2411 {-}
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \4143 /
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \4365 \{13}
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \4463 /
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \4496 \Kignore
  SET TERMINAL KEY VT100 \4543 /
</pre><p>
Replace VT100 with VT102 or other terminal type that you want to have these
definitions on the numeric keypad.  (A copy of this file is included with
Kermit 95 1.1.11 and later as KEYMAPS\KEYPAD.INI.)

Don't expect default Kermit 95 mouse button assignments to work as described

mouse driver and/or remapped your mouse buttons with a product such as the
Clicker program that comes with the Logitech Trackman.  For example, if you
have used Clicker to translate Mouse Button 2 into Double-Left-Click, then
don't expect double-clicking button 2 to paste from the Clipboard to the host.
Work around such situations by using the SET MOUSE command to remap mouse
events as desired, e.g.

"I'm running K95 1.1.10 under Windows 95.  If I invoke the DOS EDIT program
from the Kermit command screen either with !edit or by pushing to DOS and
invoking edit from DOS, when I return to K95 anything which is supposed to
display with a yellow background displays instead as blinking on a brown
background.  Normally, my 'select' colors are black on yellow.  If I am in the
command screen and type 'show terminal', the colors display properly.  If I
then type '!edit' and exit edit and return to the K95 command screen, the
previously displayed black on yellow is now blinking black on brown.  Any
colors which I change to yellow background become blinking on brown instead.
<p>

This is a limitation of Microsoft Windows 95 and NT 16-bit DOS support.
16-bit DOS programs, such as <tt>EDIT.COM</tt>, are allowed to toggle the
meaning of the VGA background-intensity bit.  Instead of using it to allow
bright colors as the background, <tt>EDIT.COM</tt> wants to use it to blink
the text.  The use of this bit to represent blinking is not supported in
window sessions but is supported in full-screen sessions.  There is no
mechanism by which a 32-bit Windows application such as Kermit-95 can change
the meaning of this bit.

worse was the fact that several of the combinations would generate the same

all keyboard combinations to be mapped to unique values.  Meeting this goal
required discarding the entire OS/2 C-Kermit keymap table and starting from
scratch.

<h3><a name="b279">279. RLOGIN versus Microsoft's "WINNUKE" Patches</a></h3>

In May 1997 hackers discovered that any Windows 95 or NT system could be
crashed by sending TCP Out Of Band (OOB) data to it on the NETBEUI port.
Microsoft's reaction was to publish a "hotfix" for Windows NT that disabled
processing of OOB data by Winsock; refer to Microsoft Knowledge Base Document
Q143478 [winnt], "Stop 0A in TCPIP.SYS When Receiving Out Of Band (OOB) Data".
But RLOGIN protocol works by using OOB data, and therefore if you have
installed these fixes, you will not be able to use RLOGIN.  This situation was
addressed in a second "hotfix" issued May 24.  Each fix is simply a
replacement of the TCP/IP stack (TCPIP.SYS).  You can (and should) install the
latest one whether or not you installed the first one.  As of this writing
there is no fix from Microsoft for Windows 95.
<p>
NOTE: If Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 has been installed, the Post-SP3 OOB
fix must be installed, since SP3 contains the first version of the OOB fix.

<h3><a name="b283">283. Can't change keyboard language in Windows 95</a></h3>

In Windows 95/98 and NT it is possible to install more than one
keyboard layout in the Keyboard Control Panel on the Input Locales
page.  When more than one Input Locale/Layout combination is defined,
you are required to choose one of them as the default, and to choose a
key combination (such as Left Alt + Shift) to switch among them.  This
is called the Switch-Locale key sequence.  The default Input-Locale is
the Input-Locale that each Window uses when it is opened.
<p>
For instance, it is possible to install:
<p><pre>
  Input Locale					Layout
  ------------------------------------------    ---------------
  English (United States)                       US
  Russian                                       Russian
</pre><p>
with "English (United States)" as the default input locale and a
Switch-Locale key sequence of "Left_Alt+Shift".  Since the keyboard
only has one alphabet on it, this "alphabet shift" key is needed to
switch between the two defined alphabets.  In Russian Windows, for
example, it is necessary to type Roman letters when you type Windows
file names or Kermit 95 commands and Cyrillic letters when writing in
the Russian language.
<p>
Although the behavior is supposed to be the same on Windows 95/98 and 
Windows NT, it turns out that it is not.
<p>
In K95 on NT you can give the following commands:
<p><pre>
  SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE 1251
  SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET CP1251
  SET TERMINAL REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET CP866
</pre><p>
When the current locale is "English (United States)" K95 receives
Roman characters from the keyboard.  When the current locale is "Russian" 
K95 receives Cyrillic characters from the keyboard.  To toggle between 
the two press the Switch-Locale key sequence.  
<p>
When issuing commands to K95 switch to the "English" locale and when
sending Cyrillic characters to the host switch to the "Russian"
locale.  There is no limitation to mixing Roman and Cyrillic
characters via this method at the K95 command prompt or in terminal
mode.
<p>
Note that only characters that are in the active code page may be delivered
to K95 from the keyboard.  In the above example code page 1251 is
used because it is available on all versions of NT and it contains all
of the Roman characters needed for U.S. English and the Cyrillic
characters used by CP866.  (CP866 is not available on the U.S. version
of NT but may be available on some international versions.)
<p>
However, when using Windows 95/98 locale switching does not work
properly in 32-bit console applications.  (The following was
tested on Windows 95 OSR2 - Russian release.)  The Russian Win95 uses
CP866 as its default code page for the DOS and Win32 Console
environments.  Therefore, both Roman and Cyrillic characters are
available for display.  
<p>
For DOS applications the current locale is ignored.  All keystrokes
generate Roman letters regardless of what locales are installed.
<p>
For 32-bit Console applications when both the "English (United
States)" and "Russian" input locales are defined and a Switch-Locale
key sequence specified it is not possible to switch the input locale
from the Default (as selected in the Keyboard Control Panel.)  The
result is that only the default language may be used.  If the default
locale is "Russian" then only Cyrillic characters may be generated
which makes it impossible to type the English commands necessary to
control Kermit 95.  If the default locale is "English" then it is not
possible to generate Cyrillic characters using the Windows Keyboard
layouts.
<p>
In this case it is possible to use K95's built-in English-to-Russian
keyboard mode with the following limitations:

The Kermit 95 version of <tt>TELNET.EXE</tt> (which simply starts Kermit 95)
assumes that <tt>K95.EXE</tt> is in the PATH.  If it is not, and it is also
not in your current directory, then <tt>TELNET.EXE</tt> will fail to start

else try specifying "<tt>C:\K95\K95.EXE</tt> <tt>-J</tt>" as your Telnet

<h3><a name="b323">323. How can I use SSH to make secure connections?</a></h3>

You don't, at least not for now.  SSH uses
encryption algorithms that fall under one or more of the following: are
prorietary, patented, require licensing, and/or are regulated for export by
the US Government.  They cannot be implemented in Kermit products without
either significant increases in the price of the software, maintenance of
separate versions for US and non-US markets, and halting distribution of
source code (for C-Kermit), binaries, and patches via the Web.
<p>
Kermit 95 1.1.16-1.1.19 have added support for Kerberos, SSL/TLS, and other
forms of security.  SSH might come later, after its patents expire.

<h3><a name="b324">324. Why can't I pick any Windows font I want?</a></h3>

In Windows 95, the available font sizes are listed in the font-size dropdown
list in the console window toolbar.  The repertoire of the font is the current
console code page, such as CP437, CP850, CP862, etc.  See Item 5 for further
information.
<p>
In Windows NT, you have a wider selection of fonts, including Unicode fonts
(which are not limited to the repertoire of the current code page), but you
still can't use just any font in the system; only the ones listed in the Fonts
section of console window Properties dialog.  NT includes and excludes fonts
from this list based on spacing, proportionality, height/width ratio, encoding,
and other factors.  The GUI version of K95 will not suffer the same
constraints.

<h3><a name="b326">326. Hints on dialing toll-free numbers </a></h3>
<p>
Suppose you use a special prefix to dial toll calls (long-distance calls),
as described on pages 112-113 of "Using C-Kermit", 2nd ed., for example:
<p><pre>
  set dial ld-prefix 18005551234
</pre><p>
If you do this, make sure you also have specified the toll-free area codes of
your local country, e.g. 800 and 888 (and soon, also 877) in the North
American Numbering Plan (NANP).  Otherwise your toll-free call will look like
a toll call to Kermit, and the long-distance prefix will be applied, which in
some cases results in failure to complete the call (e.g. you get a recorded
message like "Please don't use an access code to dial a toll-free call").
<p>
Also, make sure your toll-free dialing prefix (at least in the NANP) is the
normal long-distance dialing prefix ("1" in the NANP), not the access code for
your long-distance service provider.

<h3><a name="b327">327. Hints on "blind dialing"</a></h3>

Prior to version 1.1.14, Kermit had no special provision for "blind dialing",
i.e. forcing the modem to dial even when it does not recognize a dial tone, as
is often necessary with PBXs, in hotels, when travelling, etc, so to handle
this you had to change your modem's init string (this section explained how).
Blind dialing is now handled by the new SET DIAL IGNORE-DIALTONE command.
See <a href="ckermi70.html#x2.1.4">Section 2.1.4</a> of the C-Kermit 7.0
update notes.

<h3><a name="b328">328. Log files in multiple sessions</a></h3>

You can't open the same log file in two (or more) different K95 sessions
and have them both write to the same file.  So if you want to create a
session log, or transaction log, etc, from multiple K95 sessions at the same
time, give each one a different name.  Otherwise, the LOG TRANSACTIONS
command that you give to the second session will destroy the log created by
the first session (and so on).

<h3><a name="b337">337. Commands like "RUN D:\FOO\BAR\BAZ.BAT" don't work in Windows</a></h3>

The RUN command does not parse filenames, because the command to be run might
not be a file -- it might be built in to your shell.  So in the RUN command
(and its synonyms, "!", "SPAWN", etc), normal Kermit parsing rules regarding
backslash apply.  So to include any directory separators in a RUN or similar
command, you must double them: "RUN \\FOO\\BAR\\BAZ.BAT".  Note that in this
case you can't use forward slashes as directory separators because the normal
Windows command parser does not allow them, even though the operating system
itself does (which is why you can tell K95 to "SEND /FOO/BAR/BAZ.BAT", etc).
Furthermore, in some cases you must also use double backslashes as directory
separators in any filenames that are used as operands to the command.  (But
most programs other than the standard Windows command shell recognize forward
slashes...)  Well, this is pretty complicated, so here are some examples:
<p><pre>
  run c:\windows\notepad.exe d:\k95\tmp\oofa.txt       - doesn't work
  run c:/windows/notepad.exe d:/k95/tmp/oofa.txt       - doesn't work
  run c:\\windows\\notepad.exe d:\\k95\\tmp\\oofa.txt  - works
  run c:\\windows\\notepad.exe d:/k95/tmp/oofa.txt     - works
</pre><p>
In the last example, we use double backslashes in the command name, which are
converted by Kermit to single backslashes and then passed the Windows command
shell, so the command shell sees "<tt>c:\windows\notepad.exe</tt>
<tt>d:/k95/tmp/oofa.txt</tt>".
So it starts Notepad and passes "<tt>d:/k95/tmp/oofa.txt</tt>" to it as an
argument.  Notepad uses the regular file-opening APIs, and so it has no
trouble with forward slash as a directory separator.
<p>
Of course you can always take the easy way out if the RUN command contains no
Kermit variables or backslash escapes, as follows:
<p><pre>
  set command quoting off
  run c:\windows\notepad.exe d:\k95\tmp\oofa.txt       - works
  run c:\\windows\\notepad.exe d:\\k95\\tmp\\oofa.txt  - doesn't work
  set command quoting on
</pre><p>
SET COMMAND QUOTING OFF disables special handling of backslash by Kermit's
command parser.
<p>
Here's a case study, illustrating the effect of multiple levels of backslash
quoting...  Suppose you want to:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer a ZIP file from a UNIX workstation to Kermit 95
<li>Unzip the file with the unzipped files being placed on a floppy disk
<li>Change the attributes of the unzipped files on the floppy disk
<li>Remove the transferred ZIP file from the PC
</ul>
<p>
All under the control of the remote C-Kermit.  This can be done with an APC
command; you have to "set terminal apc unchecked" in K95 for this to work.
Please read about this in the "Using C-Kermit" manual (2nd Ed).  The following
shell script does the trick:
<p><pre>
  #!/bin/sh
  if [ $# = 0 ]; then
    echo "usage: $0 filename.zip"
    exit 1
  fi
  kermit -YQ -C \
  "set macro error on, binary, move $1,\
  apc {run unzip $1 -d A:/,del $1,run attrib +R A:\\\\\\\\*.*},exit"
</pre><p>
$1 is the shell command argument, like \%1 in Kermit.
<p>
We're unzipping the ZIP file into the top-level directory of the A: drive.
UNZIP understands forward slash as a directory separator, so "A:/" is
OK as an operand to UNZIP.
<p>
But in DOS commands like ATTRIB, we have to use "\".  But this is also (1) the
shell's escape character, (2) C-Kermit's escape character, and (3) Kermit 95's
escape character.  So when telling the shell to tell C-Kermit to tell K95 to
run a command that refers to a directory, we have to include EIGHT (= 2 to the
3rd power) backslashes for each ONE that we actually want passed to the DOS
command.

<h3><a name="b338">338. "RUN /K...." hangs K95 in Windows</a></h3>

If you include a /K switch in a RUN command, this is a switch to the Windows
command processor that means "Don't return" (/K = "keep").  So it doesn't
return.  There is nothing K95 can do about this.  This can happen
inadvertently if you were trying to use forward slashes as directory
separators: "run /k95/k95cinit".  Again: you must use backslashes as
directory separators in program names given to the RUN command: "run
\\k95\\k95cinit" (or "set command quoting off" and single backslashes).

<h3><a name="b341">341. CTL3D32.DLL is missing</a></h3>

CTL3D32.DLL is the Microsoft library that contains the 3D controls used by
the Dialer.  The Dialer can't run without it.  This DLL is a critical
component of Windows 95 that Microsoft forgot to include in Windows 95, and
so it has to be packaged with *each* GUI application, and then either
installed or not installed in this or that place depending on all sorts of
things -- and to make matters worse, there are multiple incompatible
versions.  The same is true on NT, apparently.  Microsoft itself is silent on
the subject, but there are entire web sites devoted to just this topic (try
an Alta Vista search on "ctl3d32.dll").  For 1.1.12, we have made copies of
this DLL for Windows 95 and NT (separate copies, of course) available on our
website.  In 1.1.13 and later, it is included in the release and patches.  A
new program, <tt>CTL3DINS.EXE</tt>, distributed with 1.1.13 and later, uses the
Microsoft VerInstallFile() service to install the appropriate DLL (Window 95
versus NT; Intel vs Alpha, etc) if necessary (e.g. if it is missing on your
PC or your version is older).  The behavior of VerInstallFile() is exactly
what Microsoft provides, no more and no less (as to messages, actions, lack
of choices, failure to back up any old copies).
<p>

The command line for <tt>CTL3DINS.EXE</tt> accepts and optional /F parameter
which means "Forcefully install <tt>CTL3D32.DLL</tt>".  This might be needed
if a previous application installed the NT version on Win95 or the Win95
version on NT, or if the previous version is write-protected, or at any other
time the CTL3DINS program states that -F might be used to override an error
condition.

<h3><a name="b342">342. K95 might take a long time to start and stop</a></h3>

If you choose a TAPI device as your default communications device in SETUP, or
if you have "SET LINE TAPI" or "SET TAPI LINE" command in your K95CUSTOM.INI
file, then when you start K95, it opens the TAPI line; this can take a long
time (it's TAPI, not Kermit, that is slow).  If you try to make a network
connection or to exit from K95 after the TAPI device is open, then K95 has to
ask TAPI to release the line; this takes a long time too.  So if you will not
be using a TAPI device as your normal communications device -- for example, if
you use K95 more frequently for network connections than for dialing out --
remove the aforementioned commands from your <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> file.
Then when actually do want to dial out from <tt>K95.EXE</tt>, you'll need to
"set tapi line" first (but you won't need to do anything special if you make
connections from the Dialer).

<h3><a name="b356">356. Paste to host using Toolbar Paste sends Esc O P when Num Lock on</a></h3>

When using the Paste button on the Windows toolbar (which works only if you
follow the hints in item 61 in this file), and using VT100 or higher
emulation, K95 sends Esc O P before and after the pasted text.  This is
because Windows stuffs a Num Lock key-press code into the keyboard buffer
before and after the paste.  There is no way for K95 to tell whether these Num
Lock keycodes came from the user pressing the key, or Windows stuffing the
keypress into the buffer.  So K95 sends whatever is associated with Num Lock,
which, in the case of VT emulation, is normally the PF1 or "Gold" key code,
Esc O P, and perhaps other sequences in other emulations.  The only way to
defeat this behavior is to tell K95 to ignore the Num Lock key:
<p><pre>
  set key \400  \Kignore ; Windows 95
</pre><p>
This problem does not occur in OS/2.

Some browsers, however, register URL.DLL in HKEY_CURRENT_USER and/or
HKEY_USERS rather than HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.  In that case, ShellExecute() can
not find URL.DLL, and therefore can not handle URLs.  This has been observed
(for example) with various versions of Netscape, such as 2.0.  If you install
Microsoft Internet Explorer, ShellExecute() will work, even if you do not make
Explorer your default browser.  Now we know why: because it registers URL.DLL
under the same key used by ShellExecute() to locate it.

<h3><a name="b388">388. K95 vs Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock</a></h3>

When you activate a Window, if the current state of the NumLock, ScrollLock,
CapsLock, ... flags for that window do not match those of the other sessions,
it places a NumLock, ScrollLock, CapsLock, ... key event into the message
queue for that window.
<p>
If NumLock is On, and you use the Toolbar Paste Button to paste text into the
Window, Windows 95 will toggle NumLock off and then on by surrounding the text
with NumLock key events.  See Bug Number <a href="#b356">356</a>.
<p>
If this is a problem for you, the only thing that you can do is not assign
Kverbs to those keys.  This means \Kholdscrn and \Kpf1 cannot be assigned to
the ScrollLock and Numlock keys.  Instead you should assign \Kignore.
<p>
This is a limitation of the Windows 95 Console environment.  It does not
affect GUI applications (as far as we can tell) nor does it occur on Windows
NT.

<h3><a name="b389">389. Parallel Port Communications</a></h3>

(Not a bug) In Windows NT, it is not possible to "set port lpt1" -- i.e. to
use a parallel port as a communications device, because bidirectional parallel
ports are not supported by the NT drivers.  But they are in Windows 95, which
includes a COM-to-LPT interface.  So in Windows 95, you can:
<p><pre>
  SET PORT LPT1
  SET PRINTER /DOS-DEVICE: LPT1
</pre><p>
(or other parallel-port device).  Only DOS names are allowed.  Bidirectional
parallel port support is under development by Parallel Technologies
(http://www.lpt.com) for inclusion in Windows NT 5.0 and possibly for
retroactive distribution.

<h3><a name="b417">417. Incorrect characters on screen when accessing SCO or AIX hosts</a></h3>

SCO UNIX, OpenServer, etc, and IBM AIX allow their console and/or terminal
drivers to be configured to translate character sets for you.  DON'T DO THIS
WHEN USING KERMIT!  First of all, you don't need it -- Kermit itself already
does this for you.  And second, it will (a) probably ruin the formatting of
your screens (depending on which emulation you are using); and (b) interfere
with all sorts of other things -- legibility of non-ASCII text on the terminal
screen, file transfer, etc.  On SCO systems, use:
<p><pre>
  mapchan -n
</pre><p>
to turn off this feature.  On AIX use:
<p><pre>
  setmaps -t NOMAP
</pre><p>
or:
<p><pre>
  chdev -l tty??? -a imap='none' -a omap-'none'
</pre><p>
(replacing ??? by your tty number)

<h3><a name="b418">418. K95 is unable to print to WinPrinters</a></h3>

WinPrinters (printers that only work with Windows 95) cannot print plain text.
But Kermit 95 prints using "raw mode" because many host applications send
printer-specific files such as Postscript and PCL.  Meanwhile, the Windows
32-bit printer drivers do not allow plain text to be sent to this type of
printer, but rather expect the application to convert the plain text to dots.
Workaround: SET PRINTER to a file, and then use the DOS "PRINT" command (or
"COPY /B filename PRN" or even "notepad /p filename") -- oddly enough, these
printers do come with 16-bit drivers that do the needed conversions;
unfortunately, appropriate conversions are not provided automatically for
32-bit applications.

<h3><a name="b419">419. Host mode requires VT100 or ANSI client</a></h3>

<h3><a name="b426">426. "WINOLDAP - This program has performed an illegal operation..."</a></h3>

Sometimes K95 crashes with a message something like "Winoldap: This program
has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.  If the problem
persists, contact the program vendor."  If you look at the message in more
detail, you will usually see that the crash occurred not in K95 at all, but in
the Windows kernel.  Furthermore, please be aware that "Winoldap" does not
refer to K95 -- it is not an "old" application, a DOS application, a 16-bit
application, nor is it "old" in any other way.  In fact, this term refers to
the Microsoft Console window in which Windows 95 forces <tt>K95.EXE</tt> to

<h3><a name="b436">436. Assorted problems caused by faulty optimization</a></h3>
<p>
At least the following problems showed up in 1.1.14 and 1.1.15:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to update sections of the screen during terminal emulation;
<li>Coloration mixups;
<li>In Wyse emulation, entry into protected mode caused an infinite loop;
<li>VT scrolling region problems;
<li>GET would fail after an XMODEM SEND.
</ul>
<p>

These were traced to bugs in the optimizer of the new release of the Microsoft
Visual C/C++ compiler SP2 that was used to build Kermit 95 1.1.15 for Windows.
Rebuilding the program without optimization makes these problems disappear.
K95 1.1.16 was built with SP3, with optimization turned off.  Thus the
<tt>K95.EXE</tt> file is considerably bigger, but the risks are lower (the
optimization bugs in 1.1.15 were quite subtle and took a good while to show up
and to be properly diagnosed).

<h3><a name="b437">437. Problems with Winsock 2 on Windows 95</a></h3>

The <tt>select()</tt> call problems appear to have been fixed in build
4.0.1656 of windows\system\wsock32.dll.  This release is currently available
for download at the web site (the next two lines should be concatenated):

</pre><p>
With the select() bug fixed performance is only slightly worse with 
Winsock 2.2 as it is with 1.1.  However, it should be noted that all 
development on 1.1 has now officially been stopped by Microsoft and
all future fixes will be delivered in new builds of 2.2.  This will 
include an upcoming fix to the Domain Name resolution bugs in the
current 1.1 and 2.2 code.
<p>
The Dialup Networking 1.2 and DCOM'95 updates must be installed prior to
Winsock 2 (if they are to be installed at all):

<h3><a name="b438">438. Redirection of Standard Output</a></h3>

Why can't I redirect K95's standard output?  Because K95 does not write to
standard output, it writes directly to the screen device, which can not be
redirected.  Why does it do that?  See items <a href="#b46">46</a> and <a
href="#b195">195</a>.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b439">439. Illegal operations caused by lack of swap space</a></h3>

"This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down" can
happen when Windows 95 runs out of swap space.  Windows conveniently blames
the problem on the application.  You can reconfigure your swapfile, e.g. by
moving it to a disk with more space, in the Control Panel (search for "Swap"
in Help).

<h3><a name="b440">440. Roaring Fan</a></h3>

One user reported the following: While running K95, every so often the disk
goes crazy, the PC slows down, and the fan starts roaring.  Diagnosis:
coincidence, nothing to do with Kermit; it was Microsoft Office 97 Fast Find,
which periodically wakes up and searches the disk(s) to build indexes.
We've heard of WinModems, WinPrinters, and even WinCPUs, but a WinFan???
<p>
Note: the same effect can result from any number of other helpful utilities,
such as disk defragmenters, etc, and if your PC is connected to the Internet,
also from people trying to break (into) it.

<h3><a name="b441">441. Failure to detect default printer in Windows NT</a></h3>

In Windows NT (but not 95) SET PRINTER /WINDOWS-QUEUE did not select the
default printer if it was a network printer; SET PRINTER /WINDOWS-QUEUE:?
showed only locally connected printers.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b442">442. Console mode changed from text to binary and not restored</a></h3>

In Windows 95, K95 was inadvertantly changing the Console from text to binary
mode.  No problem under most circumstances unless the program that is starting
K95 under Windows 95 relies on text-mode for gets() to succeed.  Fixed in
1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b443">443. Trouble with EXIT under certain circumstances</a></h3>

Under certain circumstances, K95 or Windows 95 itself can appear to freeze
when you try to exit from K95.  This has been observed when using Option 11 to
exit from the HOSTMODE script in Windows 95.  This problem is fixed in 1.1.16.
<p>

HINT: Remember not to try to exit from <tt>K95.EXE</tt> by clicking the Close
[x] box on the menu bar except when K95 will not exit normally.  When you
click the Close box, Windows closes Kermit 95 without releasing its resources,
which can lead to all sorts of problems until the next time you reboot
Windows.  This is a Microsoft feature over which Kermit has no control
whatever, since Windows does not send it a Close message when you click this
box, nor does it give K95 any way to disable this box.
<p>
UPDATE: In version 1.1.19, K95 disables the use of [x] box.  If you need to
shut down Kermit 95 abnormally, select the K95 window and then use
Ctrl-Alt-Del.

<h3><a name="b444">444. Overzealous EXIT warning (again)</a></h3>

An Exit Warning was generated if a TAPI device was open even if a call was not
in progress.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b445">445. RUN command did not return status</a></h3>

The RUN (!) command did not properly return the exit status of the command
or program that it ran, so it could be tested for success or failure, and
did not set the \v(pexitstat) variable to the program's or command's return
code.  Fixed in 1.1.16.  However, note that this feature works only if the
underlying shell cooperates.  The standard Windows 95 shell, COMMAND.COM,
does not.  Thus in Windows 95, K95's RUN command will always succeed when
COMMAND.COM is the shell.  Proper status is returned by the Windows NT version
of COMMAND.COM, as well as by most alternative shells for Windows 95.

<h3><a name="b446">446. Problems with DIRECTORY command filename completion</a></h3>

Fixed in 1.1.16, except there still can be problems in this and other
commands completing filenames that contain spaces.

<h3><a name="b447">447. The DIRECTORY command would return one file too few</a></h3>

Ditto for the <tt>\ffiles()</tt> function.  Incidentally, the DIRECTORY
command is implemented internally by calling the <tt>\ffiles()</tt> function,
and so this would destroy the user's <tt>\fnextfile()</tt> list if one was
active.  All these problems are fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b448">448. MKDIR command did not work in OS/2</a></h3>

Bug, fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b449">449. SET TITLE effect was delayed</a></h3>

The SET TITLE command did not take effect until the next CONNECT command.
In 1.1.16, it takes effect immediately.

<h3><a name="b450">450. BEEP command can be delayed</a></h3>

A BEEP command might take a long time to work if you have not used any
sounds recently; sound driver code might be swapped out or not yet loaded,
in which case it must be read in, and then the WAV file for the desired
sound must be read, and then the sound must be generated, which might take
some time.

<h3><a name="b451">451. CONNECT should not work if TAPI connection not open</a></h3>

The CONNECT command should refuse to work if a TAPI device is open but no
call is in progress.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b452">452. TAPI device not released when closed</a></h3>

A TAPI LINE device would not be closed properly when released (e.g. when K95
was told to hang it up and switch to another device), and this would prevent
other applications from accessing the device until K95 terminated.  Fixed in
1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b453">453. Various SET TCP command problems</a></h3>

The SET TCP NODELAY command was controlling the wrong socket parameter,
the DEBUG capability instead of the Nagle algorithm.  SET TCP commands were
not gracefully recovering from setsockopt() call failures.
Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b454">454. \v(ipaddr) didn't work before a connection was made</a></h3>

The <tt>\v(ipaddr)</tt> variable did not return the IP address of your PC
until after you had made a TCP/IP connection.  Fixed in 1.1.16.  But note that
this variable still might not return the IP Address that you expect because of
virtual adapters, etc; <tt>\v(ipaddr)</tt> is set to the IP address of the
current connection each time a new connection is made.

<h3><a name="b455">455. Assorted Telnet initialization and negotiation problems</a></h3>

Echoing, binary modes, NAWS, and most other Telnet options would not be reset
properly when connecting to ports other than 23 (the Telnet port).  This could
result in Telnet negotiations failing to complete because Kermit thought the
negotiation had already been performed.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b456">456. Spurious NUL characters on Telnet connections</a></h3>

The TELNET Network Virtual Terminal specification requires that a Carriage
Return (CR) that is not followed by a linefeed (LF) must be followed by a
NUL (ASCII 0).  These NULs should be stripped away before processing incoming
data; in most cases they were.  Exceptions: (1) they were recorded in the
session log, and (2) they were not ignored by the INPUT command.  Both
exceptions fixed in 1.1.16

<h3><a name="b457">457. Failure to recognize RLOGIN URLs</a></h3>

"rlogin://host" would not be recognized as a valid URL, since "rlogin" is not
a valid TCP service name (the proper name is "login").  Not exactly a bug,
but "rlogin" is recognized as a synonym for "login" in 1.1.16 and later.

<h3><a name="b458">458. Problems with Wyse graphics character sets in Windows NT</a></h3>

Wyse graphic characters were erroneously converted to the local Code Page
instead of to Unicode in Windows NT.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b459">459. QANSI graphics characters displayed as ASCII</a></h3>

Bug, fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b460">460. Problems with DG transparent printing</a></h3>

DG transparent printing would fail to send the escape character to the printer
if the escape sequence was not the print terminator.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b461">461. Scrolling failures in ANSI X3.64 emulations</a></h3>

NEL (= Esc E) did not scroll on bottom line of screen or scrolling region
in terminal types that followed ANSI X3.64 (including VT220 and 320, Wyse 
370, ...)  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b462">462. Incorrect appearance of VT220/320 characters after erasure</a></h3>

&#60;CSI&#62; Pn X was not erasing characters properly; it was writing blanks with the
current attributes, rather than with no attributes.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b463">463. SCOANSI and AT386 function-key programming broken</a></h3>

In SCOANSI and AT386 emulation, attempts to program function keys were being
misinterpreted as Privacy Messages (PM).  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b464">464. Various problems in HPTERM emulation</a></h3>

Status Line Messages were not being parsed; unrecognized escape sequences were
being displayed on screen.  The entire emulation was rewritten to parse HP
sequences in a general way, avoiding special cases.

<h3><a name="b465">465. Problems in Siemens/Nixdorf BA80 emulation</a></h3>

BA80 emulation did not handle Function Key Labels or Status Line commands.
Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b466">466. Spurious red lines on debug-mode terminal screens</a></h3>

When Terminal screen is in debug mode and a CR and/or LF arrives when the
cursor is on the right margin, an extraneous blank line in debug color is
displayed.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b467">467. Alt-x, Alt-h, etc, don't seem to work in AIXTERM (not a bug)</a></h3>

They don't, because AIXTERM remaps these as extended function keys; for
example, Alt-x sends &#60;CSI&#62;102q (see DEFAULT.INI).  K95 reassigns its own
functions to the uppercase Alt keys, Alt-X, Alt-H, etc.

<h3><a name="b468">468. Difficulties pasting</a></h3>

Mouse-pasting using the Kermit method (double-click button 2) tends not to
work because any miniscule motion between the two mouse clicks raises a drag
event, thus putting Kermit into Mark Mode (which can be canceled with a
terminal reset (Alt-R) or with Ctrl-F2 (Cancel Mark Mode).  Fixed in 1.1.16.
Workaround - Add the following commands to your K95CUSTOM.INI file:
<p><pre>
  SET MOUSE BUTTON 2 NONE DRAG \Kmousecopyclip
  SET MOUSE BUTTON 3 NONE DRAG \Kmousecopyclip
</pre>

<h3><a name="b469">469. Echoing delays</a></h3>

On certain PCs, under certain circumstances, there might be a slight delay in
echoing of the characters you type.  A large part of the delay is in the
connection itself, but other components of it are attributable to Windows
scheduling of K95's several threads and its semaphore management, especially
under heavy system load, and to overhead from <tt>CONAGENT.EXE</tt>, which
controls the window that K95 runs in.  The situation was improved dramatically
in K95 1.1.16.

<p>
Note that you can use SET TERMINAL SCREEN-UPDATE { FAST, SMOOTH } to control
the tradeoff between high throughput (FAST) and snappy echoing (SMOOTH); see
the <a href="setterm.html">SET TERMINAL Command List</a>
for details.  Also see item <a href="#b27">27</a> in this file.

<h3><a name="b470">470. MSKERMIT keycode for Ctrl-Enter was incorrect</a></h3>

Bug, fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b471">471. APC command containing SET TERM TYPE would stop</a></h3>

A SET TERMINAL TYPE command in an APC command would reset the terminal
emulator, thus clearing the APC status even though an APC was still in
progress.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b472">472. Failure to receive files with long names on some systems</a></h3>

On Windows NT or OS/2, if K95 was set to FILE NAMES LITERAL and a file
arrived to be stored on a FAT partition restricted to 8.3 filenames,
and the file had a long name or a name otherwise illegal for FAT, the file
transfer would fail unnecessarily.  In 1.1.16, the name is transformed just
enough to make it legal for FAT.

<h3><a name="b473">473. Autodownload failures with parity mismatch</a></h3>

Kermit or Zmodem autodownloads would fail to work if K95's parity was set
differently to what the host was sending.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b474">474. File transfer thermometer might not complete</a></h3>

Due to some reorganization of K95's threads for better error and interrupt
trapping, K95's file-transfer display thermometer might not go all the way to
the end on the last or only file, especially if it is a short file.  However,
the Percent Done field still registers 100%, and the Last Message field still
shows file and byte count and characters per second, and indicates a
successful transfer (if the transfer was indeed successful).  SHOW STATUS will
also reveal the success or failure of the transfer.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b475">475. XYZMODEM statistics counted each file twice</a></h3>

After downloading when XMODEM, YMODEM, or ZMODEM, K95 would report twice the
number of files that were actually downloaded.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b476">476. SET TERMINAL TYPE might mishandle 7-bit NRCs</a></h3>

An internal problem that occurred only when the terminal type was set to
ANSI-BBS, SCOANSI, and AT386 emulations, which don't use 7-bit National
Replacement Character-sets (NRCs) anyway.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b477">477. Problems typing 7-bit national characters</a></h3>

Refer to entry 430.  Fixed in 1.1.16.  Characters can now be assigned to keys
without translation with the new SET TERM KEY <mode> /LITERAL switch.

<h3><a name="b478">478. Problem Selecting HP-Roman8 character set from the Dialer</a></h3>

When you choose HP-Roman8 as the remote character set in the Dialer, it writes
"set term remote-char hproman8", but it should have included a dash
("hp-roman8").  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b479">479. RETURN within SWITCH didn't work</a></h3>

Bug, fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b480">480. \ffiles() counted directories when it shouldn't</a></h3>

The number of files reported by <tt>\ffiles()</tt> was always at least two
greater than it should have been, since it was counting "<tt>.</tt>" and
"<tt>..</tt>" (and any other directory) as files.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b481">481. Problems with REMOTE QUERY KERMIT function()</a></h3>

REMOTE QUERY KERMIT function(\%a) did not evaluate its argument before sending
the query to the server; thus it was not possible to have the server run the
function with client-side variables as arguments.  Fixed in 1.1.16.  Details
in <a href="ckermi70.html#x5.2">Section 5.2</a> of the C-Kermit 7.0
Update Notes.

<h3><a name="b482">482. K95 Host Mode might be slow to put up Login prompt</a></h3>

When Kermit 95 receives an incoming TCP connection, it looks up the incoming
IP address to get the hostname, primarily so that your hostmode logs and
displays will contain accurate information and not spoofed or forged names;
this is standard practice on the Internet these days.  This query, however,
could take a long time -- if your local Domain Name Server can not satisfy it,
it goes out to the Internet, and we all know how snappy the Internet at
times...  In 1.1.16, you can defeat the pause with the new SET TCP
REVERSE-DNS-LOOKUP OFF command.

<h3><a name="b483">483. Host mode requires ANSI or VT terminal emulator</a></h3>

(Duplicate of 419; see Bug Number <a href="#b419">419</a>.)

<h3><a name="b484">484. Host-mode maximum users setting wouldn't stick</a></h3>

Typographical error in hostmode.ksc, fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b485">485. Dialer Login Script text box data lost in OS/2</a></h3>

<tt>K2DIAL.EXE</tt> would lose data in the Settings Notebook Login Script Text
box if the Printer entry field is edited AND the LOGIN page is not displayed.
The bug appears in both Warp 3.0 and 4.0.  Diagnosis: Compiler optimization
bug in IBM VAC++.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b486">486. Dialer Printer Type combo box could not be set</a></h3>

The Dialer Printer Type Combo box could not be set to File, Pipe, or None
types from saved values.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b487">487. Dialer Communications page speed entry wouldn't stick</a></h3>

The Dialer entry Communications page would not retain the override speed
unless flow control was also overridden.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b488">488. HINTS: Alphanumeric Paging</a></h3>

(Not a bug.)  If you can't get the Alpha paging script to work:
<p><ol type="a">
<li>Check with your paging service to make sure you have the right
settings (phone number, speed, parity, flow control), and modify the
APAGE macro in APAGE.KSC accordingly.
<p>
<li>If, when dialing, you still get only garbage and/or immediate hangups,
you'll need to identify the settings to *force* your modem to dial the
paging service in such a way that the two modems can communicate.  Look
in your modem manual for commands related to modulation, fallback, and
speed buffering.  You want the modem to dial at 1200 (or whatever the
appropriate speed is), using the appropriate modulation, and you want
it to stay at that speed after the connection is made, and you want the
interface to stay at that speed too.  It often turns out that old
modems like the Hayes 1200 work just fine with paging services, where
more modern models tend to fail because of complications during
the modulation and protocol negotiation phase -- so do whatever you can
to turn your fancy new modem into a dumb old one.  Hint: use the new
SET MODEM PREDIAL-INIT command to specify any commands you want sent to
the modem just prior to dialing.
<p>
<li>In the APAGE macro, try changing the flow control and/or parity to
NONE, even if that is contrary to what your paging service told you.
<p>
<li>Try adding "set output pacing 200" (or other number) to the APAGE
macro -- this makes the difference with many paging services.
</ol>
<p>
K95 probably can't be used to send pages from a modem that is connected to
a terminal server, since it has no way to set the terminal server's
communication port parameters -- speed, parity, etc -- as required by the
paging service.

<h3><a name="b489">489. HINTS: For Blind Users</a></h3>

Kermit 95 reportedly works fine in Windows 95 when (a) used in conjunction
with ASAP screen-reader software from Microtalk, and (b) all of the numeric
keypad keys are mapped to <tt>\Kignore</tt>.  Read the K95 FAQ for details.
<p>
Beginning in version 1.1.16, K95 should work with all speech devices and
Braille devices that work with other Windows or OS/2 console applications.
Use SET TERMINAL SCREEN-UPDATE SMOOTH and SET TERMINAL SCREEN-OPTIMIZE ON.

<h3><a name="b490">490. HINTS: Telnetting to OS/2</a></h3>

The Telnet server in recent versions of OS/2 (probably starting with Warp 4)
evidently does character-set translation from CP850 to Latin1, which can
interfere with the K95 Telnet client's screen formatting, especially if you
are trying to use the ANSI terminal type.  Cure: Start OS/2 telnetd with the
"-cp none" parameter.  Then "set term type ansi" in Kermit 95 should work as
expected.  But note that function keys are not supported since they are not
part of ANSI emulation, and in any case there is no provision for them in IBM
telnetd.  Ditto for Alt keys, the gray keypads, etc.

<h3><a name="b491">491. HINTS: How to use K95 with Netscape Communicator 4.0</a></h3>

(Not a bug) In Netscape 4.0:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Edit->Preferences
<li>Select Category: Navigator->Applications
<li>Select Description: "URL: Telnet Protocol"
<li>Select Edit
<li>Select Handled by Application:
<li>Fill in one of the following:<pre>
  c:\k95\k95.exe -J %1
  c:\k95\telnet.exe
  c:\k95\k95.exe -c -j %1 -S
</pre>
or any other valid command line.
</ul>
<p>
(Replace "c:\k95" by the path of your actual Kermit 95 directory.)
<p>
Also: The K95REGTL program was made available on October 2, 1997, for download
from the Kermit web/ftp site, and is included with K95 1.1.16.  This program
can be used to register Kermit 95 as the default Telnet application to be used
by any browser at all: ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/utils/READ.ME.

<h3><a name="b492">492. TEMP or TMP environment variable definition can cause problems</a></h3>

In Windows 95 and Windows 98 (but not Windows NT or OS/2), if the TMP or TEMP
environment variable is defined to be the root directory of a disk,
unpredictable behavior can ensue, including crashes ("This program has
performed an illegal operation and will be shut down"), not only in Kermit 95,
but in other applications as well.  This is worked around in K95 1.1.16 by
checking for this in advance and posting a warning, but the problem itself
occurs in the external DLLs that are used by K95 and other applications, not
in K95 itself.  Diagnosis: Many libraries (including the TAPI and Kerberos IV
DLLs) use the TEMP or TMP definition to construct names for temporary files,
by prepending the TEMP or TMP definition to the file name, with a backslash
(\) in between.  If (say) TMP is set to "D:\", and the temporary file is to be
named "tmp", this results in "D:\\tmp".  Windows 95/98 mistakes this for a UNC
(which is a bug, because UNCs do not start with disk letters) and tries to
find a network node called "tmp".  This can result in long delays or worse,
and at the very least, failure to create the temporary file, with results that
depend on each application or library.  The bug was reported to Microsoft,
which declined to address it.

<h3><a name="b493">493. The GET Command Versus Filenames with Spaces</a></h3>

Prior to version 1.1.16, and K95 was in server mode, there was no obvious
way to send a GET command to it for a file whose name contained spaces.
Now the server allows such names to be enclosed in curly braces or
doublequotes.  See
<a href="ckermi70.html#x5.4">Section 5.4</a> of the C-Kermit 7.0
Update Notes.

<h3><a name="b494">494. HINT: CR and/or LF disappear!</a></h3>

You have connected to a host that is using even (or mark, or odd) parity,
but Kermit's terminal bytesize is 8 and its parity setting is NONE.  This
usually happens only on serial connections direct to serial ports on UNIX
hosts.  Careful, you get a terminal bytesize of 8 by default when using
VT220 or 320, or any kind of ANSI, emulation.  Cure: SET TERMINAL BYTESIZE 7,
or SET PARITY to match what is used by the host.

<h3><a name="b495">495. HINT: Eliminating "Press a key to continue" after RUN Command.</a></h3>

This message is issued when a RUN command is given at the prompt, to give you
time to read the screen before returning to K95's command screen.  The prompt
is not given when the RUN command is issued from a macro or a command file.
Thus you can avoid it by defining a macro that does what run does:
<p><pre>
  define xrun run \%*
</pre><p>
and then using the macro rather than the RUN command itself.  Note: \%* means
"all arguments".

<h3><a name="b496">496. Cursor positioning on double-width lines</a></h3>

Cursor positioning on double-width lines could be incorrect.  Bug, fixed
in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b497">497. Errors in Default Keymap for EMACS Mode</a></h3>

PgUp was mapped to ESC V instead of ESC v (lowercase).
Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b498">498. SET HOST * Port Not Freed</a></h3>

On TCP/IP connections, the SET HOST * listening port was not freed until
K95 termination.  In 1.1.16 it is closed and freed when a SET HOST, SET PORT,
or CLOSE CONNECTION command is issued.  And of course, also on EXIT.

<h3><a name="b499">499. Unwanted Command Screen Size Change</a></h3>

If an escape sequence was received from the host that instructed K95 to change
the height/width of the Terminal screen while it was processing an INPUT
command, the physical height/width of the Command screen would also be changed
although its virtual height/width would not be.  Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b500">500. MKDIR/RMDIR Problems with UNCs</a></h3>

Directory specifications such as \\node\directory were not handled correctly.
Fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b501">501. MKDIR/RMDIR Problems when Used in Macros or Command Files</a></h3>

Bug, fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b502">502. RUN, REDIRECT, PIPE Interaction with Nonstandard Shells</a></h3>

There is no single standard interface for invoking command shells.  But K95
must invoke your command shell when you give a RUN, REDIRECT, or PIPE command
since (a) K95 has no way of knowing whether the text argument of your RUN,
REDIRECT, or PIPE command is a built-in shell command, an external program, a
shell script, a batch file, or what, and (b) if it is an external program, it
is up to your shell to find it.  As of 1.1.16, K95 has built-in knowledge of
the calling conventions of various alternative shells, including 4DOS, 4NT,
the Hamilton C-Shell, the Korn shell, the MKS Shell, ASH, and BASH.

<h3><a name="b503">503. Compression Skipped in Text-Mode Kermit File Transfers</a></h3>

Bug, fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b504">504. Slow Local Echo in Terminal Screen</a></h3>

Bug, fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b505">505. Slow Echo in Terminal Screen on Serial Connections</a></h3>

Bug, fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b506">506. Problems with Bidirectional Printer Configuration in Dialer</a></h3>

SET PRINTER /BIDI was not putting all of the configuration options on the same
line.  Bug, fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b507">507. Missing Error Messages in OUTPUT and INPUT</a></h3>

The OUTPUT and INPUT commands would fail silently under certain conditions,
e.g. if the connection was lost.  As of 1.1.16 a proper error message is
issued.

<h3><a name="b508">508. Problems Editing Certain Commands</a></h3>

SET KEY (in its multiline format) and SET MODEM would react badly to editing
via Backspace, Ctrl-W, etc.  Bug, fixed in 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b509">509. Redirection of Certain REMOTE Commands Didn't work</a></h3>

If the server sent back a "short-form reply" to a REMOTE command, and your
REMOTE command had a redirection indicator, it was ignored.  Bug, fixed in
1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b510">510. K95 did not work well with Citrix Winframe</a></h3>

When K95 1.1.15 or earlier was used for terminal emulation over a Winframe 
ICA connection into a Citrix Winframe, performance was very poor.  Diagnosis:
Winframe performs optimization on GUI windows but not Console windows.  K95
1.1.16 overcomes this problem by doing screen optimization itself.  The same
is probably true for Microsoft Hydra (the Windows Terminal Server) and its
various third-party clients ("Windows terminals" from Boundless, Network
Computing Devices, Neoware Systems, Tektronix, and Wyse).  This might also
help with slowness that was reported under Windows NT with certain video
drivers.

<h3><a name="b511">511. Wyse 370 colors didn't work</a></h3>

The Windows Console driver supports only 16 colors, whereas the Wyse 370
supports 64.  Prior to version 1.1.16, K95 ignored Wyse 370 coloration
directives.  Beginning in 1.1.16, it attempts to map them into the 16
available colors.  K95 will handle Wyse 370 colors better after conversion
to full GUI is complete.

<h3><a name="b512">512. CJK Input Method Editors do not work in Windows 95</a></h3>

Chinese users have reported success viewing ideographic text on the screen
when using AT386 and similar emulations (which automatically choose 8-bit
characters and no translation), they are not able to enter Chinese (or Korean,
or Japanese, etc) characters on the keyboard.  This is because Microsoft chose
to disable CJK Input Method Editors (IME) in Windows 95 Console windows.  See
Microsoft Knowledge Base Article Q156793: "All Far East versions of Windows
NT 4.0 support IME in a command prompt.  Only the Japanese version of Windows
NT 3.51 supports IME in a command prompt.  None of the Far East versions of
Windows 95 support IME in a command prompt."  When an IME is not supported,
Microsoft recommends that you "enter the Chinese, Japanese, or Korean
characters into Notepad or WordPad and then paste them into the command
prompt".

<h3><a name="b513">513. Conflict between mouse and screen saver</a></h3>

It has been reported on systems with Logitech MouseWare Control Center 7.10
and driver 7.00, the mouse stops working when a screen saver is activated.
This has nothing to do with Kermit 95.

<h3><a name="b514">514. Improper bolding in VT reverse-screen mode</a></h3>

The VT 220 or 320 emulator, when in reverse screen mode (DECSCNM), would
apply the Bold attribute to the foreground rather than to the background of
the cell.  Fixed in 1.1.16.  Also, there was no equivalent to the VT220/320
"screen mode" setup selection (even though there was a Kverb, \Kflipscreen,
for this); this was added as SET TERMINAL SCREEN-MODE { NORMAL, REVERSE } in
version 1.1.16.

<h3><a name="b515">515. Dialer does not work in OS/2 2.x</a></h3>

As of K95 1.1.14, the OS/2 version of the Dialer uses Work Place Shell
features that are compatible only with with OS/2 3.0 and higher.
<tt>K2.EXE</tt> itself can be used with OS/2 2.0 and later.

<h3><a name="b516">516. Log files can disappear in Windows 95 if K95 killed</a></h3>

In Windows 95, if K95 has a transaction, session, or other log open, and is
killed from the task list, or crashes, or Windows itself crashes, the log file
might be truncated, empty, or nonexistent.  This is how Windows 95 works.
This does not happen in Windows NT.  To work around this Windows 95 problem,
close and reopen essential logs periodically, to force commitment to disk,
using APPEND mode in subsequent opens.  Windows NT (or UNIX, etc) is
recommended for critical applications.

<h3><a name="b517">517. Code Page 856 isn't really a code page</a></h3>

Code Page 856, used in Bulgaria, was evidently made up by a Bulgarian company
without checking first whether there already was a CP856.  And indeed there
is: IBM Code Page 856 is for Hebrew.  Furthermore, the code table for CP856,
from which K95 support was added, is evidently only one of several variations.
Testing has shown that, depending on the terminal emulation, Cyrillic letters
are OK but box-drawing characters are not, or vice versa.  The Bulgarian
company has noted that this is to be expected.  "CP856" is now referred to
in K95 and C-Kermit as "bulgaria-pc".

<h3><a name="b518">518. SET TERMINAL IDLE-xxx command misdocumented</a></h3>

<i>(<a href="k95fixes.html#b518">Fixed</a>.)</i>  The fixed description is
in the <a href="setterm.html">SET TERMINAL Command List</a>.

<h3><a name="b519">519. New screen updating method might not be good for everybody</a></h3>

The new optimized screen updating method might not be an improvement on every
PC.  Evidently results can vary with the video adapter and driver, etc.  If
you prefer the screen-updating method of K95 1.1.15, you can restore it by
putting the following command:
<p><pre>
  set terminal screen-optimize off
</pre><p>
in your K95CUSTOM.INI file.  At least one person has described a long
delay in cursor position updating which is corrected by turning off the
additional screen-optimizing calculations.

<h3><a name="b520">520. Problems invoking <tt>RLOGIN.EXE</tt> and <tt>TELNET.EXE</tt></a></h3>

As noted elsewhere, spaces in file and directory names are a Very Bad Idea.
Thus we do not recommend installing K95 in directories such as:
<p><pre>
  C:\Program Files
</pre><p>
One consequence of doing this is that the Kermit 95 <tt>TELNET.EXE</tt> and
<tt>RLOGIN.EXE</tt> stubs don't work when invoked from outside the Kermit 95
directory (e.g. from the Start menu).  Workaround: Use the "FAT" (8.3) name
for the path when starting <tt>RLOGIN.EXE</tt> or <tt>TELNET.EXE</tt>.  Or
move Kermit 95 to a directory whose name has no spaces.  <tt>RLOGIN.EXE</tt>
and <tt>TELNET.EXE</tt> have been reprogrammed in version 1.1.17 to cope with
this situation.

<h3><a name="b521">521. AIXTERM, HFT, SCOANSI, AT386 scrolling problem</a></h3>

Scroll Up and Scroll Down (SU/SD escape sequences) don't work right.
Fixed in version 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b522">522. Program crash during XMODEM transfer</a></h3>

K95 will crash during an XMODEM transfer over a serial connection if
carrier detect drops during the file transfer.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b523">523. No means to receive XMODEM transfers with CRC block checking</a></h3>

CRC block checking must be specified by the receiver.  K95 currently
provides no way to specify this.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b524">524. (Two Bugs, One Number)</a></h3>

Two bugs were accidentally assigned to number 524:
<p>
<i>524.1 QANSI emulation bugs</i>
<p>
The default character sets were wrong.  They should be:
<p><pre>
  G0 - ASCII
  G1 - DecSpecial
  G2 - Latin1
  G3 - DecSpecial
</pre><p>
K95 did not interpret the character 'U' as an indicator for CP437
in the ISO 2022 escape sequences.  This is a non-standard identifier.
<p>
K95 did not properly implement CSI 10/11/12 m.  The previous implementation
would work since the default characters was CP437.  
<p>
Cursor Horizontal Absolute was not implemented.
<p>
All fixed in 1.1.17.
<p>
<i>524.2 Cursor position on Double Width line vs. Horizontal Scrolling</i>
<p>
The cursor when positioned on a double-width line will be displayed
on the wrong column if K95's internal horizontal scrolling is used.
Fixed in 1.1.17  

<h3><a name="b525">525. Invalid TMP or TEMP directory will cause K95DIAL to crash</a></h3>

If the TMP or TEMP variables are defined but point to a non-existent
directory or a file, the dialer will crash at startup.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b526">526. INPUT command sets \v(instatus) to wrong value</a></h3>

If no connection is in progress instatus is set to 3 (Internal Error)
when it should be set to 4 (I/O error).  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b527">527. SET TERMINAL ESCAPE-CHARACTER does not work</a></h3>

The command is supposed to accept ENABLED or DISABLED with aliases
of ON or OFF.  The command only accepts the aliases in 1.1.16.  Fixed in
1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b528">528. TCP/IP sessions do not work on OS/2 3.0</a></h3>

OS/2 3.0 does not allow more than 32K of data to be read from the
TCP/IP socket even if more than 32K is waiting.  This is due to 
the use of signed ints in the TCP/IP stack instead of unsigned ints.
Version 1.1.17 restricts reads to 32K as in previous releases.
This bug does not affect Warp 4.0.

<h3><a name="b529">529. OS variables not properly set in OS/2</a></h3>

The \v(osname), \v(osrelease), and \v(osversion) variables are not
properly set on OS/2 in version 1.1.16.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b530">530. Win95/98 does not randomly access pooled IP hosts</a></h3>

When accessing a pooled IP host, each attempt is supposed to access a random
host in the pool.  If Win95/98 is not configured for a WINS server it is
possible that the internal WINS cache may prevent PING, K95, and possibly
other applications from being able to randomly access a pooled host and
resolve the real name of the host being connected to.  This results in
authentication failures with Kerberos 4 and Kerberos 5.  Microsoft will not
be fixing this problem; they have designated it a feature.

<h3><a name="b531">531. Kerberos authentication fails with "invalid network address"</a></h3>

If a machine has multiple adapters installed (physical or virtual) and
Kerberos is unable to tell which one to use, it might choose the wrong one.
If so, the IP address associated with the Kerberos ticket does not match the
IP address used to connect to the host.  This results in an "invalid network
address" error and authentication failure.
<p>
Workaround: Disable or remove adapters that are not in use if possible.
<p>
This bug is also present in Microsoft Proxy Server.

<h3><a name="b532">532. PAUSE command always reports FAILURE</a></h3>

FAILURE should only be reported if the PAUSE command was interrupted by the
user pressing a key.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b533">533. Kermit 95 could not display the EURO character</a></h3>

The inability of Kermit 95 to display the Euro character is caused by two
problems:
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li>K95 1.1.16 and earlier did notsupport any character-sets (or code pages)
that contain the Euro character.  This has been addressed in 1.1.17 by the
addition of ISO 8859-15 (IBM Code Page 923) and IBM Code Page 858.  ISO
8859-15 is expected to become the new default character-set for Europe after
Jan 1, 1999.  CP858 is CP850 modified to replace the dotless i with the Euro
symbol.  Version 1.1.17 also supports the expanded versions of Windows Code
Pages 1250 to 1257, in which the Euro character was added in a formerly vacant
position.
<p>
<li>The operating system does not support the Euro symbol.  Microsoft is
supposed to be adding the Euro symbol to NT 4.0 in Service Pack 4 due out
Summer 1998.  IBM has replaced CP850 with CP858 in OS/2 Warp 3.0 FP35 or
higher, or OS/2 Warp 4.0 FP6 or higher.  Windows 98 supports the Euro
for GUI applications but not for Console applications.
<p>
Microsoft has posted the Win95 Euro update (without Console window
support) at:
<p><pre>
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/contents/Updates/W95EuroPatch/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/contents/Updates/W95EuroPatch/default.asp</a>
</pre><p>
Research has shown that the Monotype.com true type font available from
Microsoft's http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm
(which includes the Euro character) is available for use in console
windows on Win NT immediately after installation.  This font is thinner 
than Lucida Console and is therefore better suited to those sites that 
need 132 columns.  
<p>
The font can also be used in Win95 console Windows if the Registry 
is edited and if the key 
<p><pre>
  HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MS-DOS Emulation\
</pre><p>
is edited to read 
<p><pre>
  "Font"="Monotype.com"
</pre><p>
Charles Bigelow of Bigelow and Holmes's has also pointed out that
Microsoft could receive and distribute the latest version of 
Lucida Console which contains not only the Euro but also the missing
Hebrew and Arabic glyphs for free whenever they want to from 
Monotype, the company that distributes the True Type versions of
B&=38;H's typefaces.
</ol>
<p>
As of Kermit 95 1.1.17, if the operating system provides support for the
Euro, then Kermit 95 is able to display it.

<h3><a name="b534">534. TES32 for Win95 connections fail immediately</a></h3>

K95 attempts to test the connection with a function that is not implemented
in the device driver.  A workaround is provided in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b535">535. \fsplit() function parses extra words</a></h3>

The function does not stop splitting words at the end of the string.
Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b536">536. Cursor can disappear in command screen</a></h3>

When switching from the Terminal screen to the command screen, the cursor
might disappear.  This is because the Windows API for restoring the cursor
fails to work -- i.e. another Microsoft bug.  Experimentation shows that
reCONNECTing and escaping back tends to revive the Command-screen cursor.

<h3><a name="b537">537. '\' at end of key definition cannot be sent to host</a></h3>

If a key is defined with either SET KEY or SET TERM KEY with a value
ending in '\' such as:
<p><pre>
   &#60;ESC&#62;_1&#60;ESC&#62;\
</pre><p>
the '\' will not be sent.  Now the way this really needs to be written
since '\' is a quote character and kverbs and variables may be embedded
into the string is 
<p><pre>
   SET KEY \<i>nnnn</i> \27_1\27\\
</pre><p>
but because the string gets parsed twice, once and the command line
and once before it is sent
<p><pre>
   SET KEY \<i>nnnn</i> \27_1\27\\\\
</pre><p>
but this results in 
<p><pre>
   &#60;ESC&#62;_1&#60;ESC&#62;\\
</pre><p>
being sent to the host.  The following workaround may be used if
you do not need the definition to be general (for all terminal types)
and the rest of the string does not contain kverbs or variables.
<p><pre>
  SET TERM KEY <term> /LITERAL \<i>nnnn</i> \27_1\27\\
</pre><p>
Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b538">538. LOOKUP command does not return failure</a></h3>

The LOOKUP command does not set STATUS to FAILURE if the specified name
is either not found or ambiguous.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b539">539. Function rindex fails to match first instance of string</a></h3>

<tt>\frindex()</tt> would fail to match the first instance of a string if a
starting index is specified.
<p><pre>
  \frindex(r,rr,1) 
</pre><p>
returns 1 when it should return 2.  Whereas 
<p><pre>
  \frindex(r,rr)
</pre><p>
returns 2 as it should.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b540">540. Non-CP437 extended characters displayed improperly in NT</a></h3>

When Unicode support is active, all extended characters (those within
the range 128-255) are displayed in CP437 regardless of the settings
of SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE and SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET.
Fixed in 1.1.17.  
<p>
It should be noted that the default code page for console windows does
not match for GUI windows.  For instance, in the U.S., the default GUI
code page is 1252 while the default console code page is 437.  This
affects the characters that may be produced by the keyboard and
delivered to K95.  It is also important to realize that while K95 uses
Unicode as an intermediary step in translating all characters and
stores all display characters in Unicode, Unicode is only used for
display output and is not in any way used for keyboard input.
Therefore, it is very important that both SET TERMINAL CODE-PAGE and
SET TERMINAL LOCAL-CHARACTER-SET be assigned to an equivalent value.

<h3><a name="b541">541. In NT, dead keys produce an error beep when pressed</a></h3>

In NT, dead keys are delivered to the application even if they are
not generating a character.  For instance, ~a is delivered as two
key events.  The first without a character value and the second with
a character value.  Since the first comes without a value K95 thinks
it is similar to a function or gray key and when it finds no macro
or kverb assigned to it, K95 beeps.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b542">542. SET BELL VISIBLE does not work reliably </a></h3>

The Visible bell was broken in 1.1.16 when implementing the screen
diff optimization.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b543">543. SET TELNET ENCRYPTION {REFUSED, ACCEPTED, ... } broken</a></h3>

The SET TELNET ENCRYPTION {...} command when used to set anything
other than the TYPE of encryption to be used does not work in 1.1.16.
Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b544">544. Max Command Length is not necessarily max length of macros</a></h3>

The SHOW COMMAND Max Command Length (10238 chars) is supposed to be 
the max length of macros.  However, it turns out the lower levels of 
the command parser restrict this size to 4071 characters.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b545">545. END command numeric value is inaccessible to scripts</a></h3>

The syntax of the END command allows for an optional numeric value.
This value is used to set the status of the IF SUCCESS and IF FAILURE
tests.  A value of '0' is SUCCESS and non-zero is FAILURE.  However,
there is no way for a script to perform a switch and the actual
numeric end code that is specified which makes error handling 
difficult.  In 1.1.17, the END value is available in \v(return).

<h3><a name="b546">546. 10-digit dialing rules forgets to dial the area code</a></h3>

When the SET DIAL LC-AREA-CODES command is used to specify area codes
that should be dialed as local instead of long distance, Kermit
would forget to dial the area code.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b547">547. GET/REGET with SET FILE PATTERNS ON may corrupt files</a></h3>

With K95 in SERVER mode, if GET is used to transfer a file which matches
a TEXT file pattern it will be sent as TEXT regardless of the client's
file transfer setting.  However, the REGET command will transfer the
file as BINARY which may corrupt the file.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b548">548. REMOTE commands may set STATUS to SUCCESS on FAILURE</a></h3>

If a REMOTE command fails due to an error that results in either an
E-packet being sent or received (ie, "Too many retries") it is possible
that the STATUS flag will be set to SUCCESS even though the REMOTE 
command failed.  Fixed in 1.1.17. 

<h3><a name="b549">549. RUN command interferes with screen updates in a script</a></h3>

A simple script such as the following will exhibit screen update problems
<p><pre>
  for \%i 1 10 1 {
    echo This is line \%i
  }
  run sleep 5
  wait 15
</pre><p>
This is because the Screen Update thread is not given the opportunity
to update the screen with the output from the ECHO command before the
RUN is executed.  When the RUN command completes the WAIT command (which 
generates no output) delays the screen update until after the WAIT 
completes.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b550">550. \fword() fails to find the last word in a string</a></h3>

The sequence:
<p><pre>
  assign line {word1 word2 word3}
  echo \fword(\m(line), 3)
</pre><p>
would echo a blank line instead of word3.  Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b551">551. Partial Dialing misuses dialing rules</a></h3>

When using partial dialing, the prefixing and suffixing rules apply
to each PDIAL and DIAL command instead of prefixing only the first.
Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b552">552. The PRODUCT macro had an extraneous parameter</a></h3>

The PRODUCT macro, added in 1.1.16, was always given an extra parameter with
the value '1'.  If the command &#60;CSI&#62; < 1 ; 2 ; 3 ~ is sent to Kermit 95, the
product macro will be called with four parameters and \%4 will equal '1'.
Fixed in 1.1.17.

<h3><a name="b553">553. SETUP from CDROM might not exit cleanly</a></h3>

When installing in Windows from the CDROM, the Windows "Autorun"
starts the <tt>SETUP.EXE</tt> program automatically.  When the SETUP program
exits, the Console window might not close automatically.  No harm done;
just click the close button [x].

<h3><a name="b554">554. URL hot spots vs Netscape Communicator</a></h3>

It has been observed that, at least on some systems, Netscape 4.0 discards
the "/" characters from links passed to it in a DDE message, as when you
Ctrl-click on a URL in K95.  This seems to happen only when the browser
was already started.  Workaround: If SHOW BROWSER reveals a specific browser,
type "set browser" (with no operand) to remove it.  Then all your system
defaults are used, this seems to clear up the problem (in which case,
add "set browser" to your K95CUSTOM.INI file) (K2CUSTOM.INI in OS/2).

<h3><a name="b555">555. Missing files (not really)</a></h3>

Numerous text files were removed in 1.1.17, on purpose.  All the information
in these files was incorporated into the new Second Edition Kermit 95 manual,
which is now in your Kermit 95 <tt>DOCS\MANUAL</tt> directory, and accessible
from the Dialer's Help menu.  The files affected are:
<p><pre>
  DOCS\CYRILLIC.TXT    Incorporated into HTML manual
  DOCS\HEBREW.TXT      Incorporated into HTML manual
  DOCS\DIALING.TXT     Incorporated into Using C-Kermit, 2nd Edition

  DOCS\UPDATES.TXT     Incorporated into HTML manual
  KEYMAPS\KVERBS.TXT   Incorporated into HTML manual
</pre><p>
Note: In Windows, those who install 1.1.17 (or later) new, as opposed to
patching up to it, will also get a desktop shortcut to the manual.  Those who
patch up to 1.1.17 (or later) can make a shortcut as follows:
<p><pre>
  My Computer .. <i>k95 disk .. k95 directory</i> .. Docs .. Manual
</pre><p>
Right-click on kermit95.htm, choose Create Shortcut, and drag the shortcut to
the desired place.
<p>
Or <tt>K95REGTL.EXE</tt> may be executed manually in order to re-create the
Documentation Shortcuts.

<h3><a name="b556">556. DATE command does not return to command prompt</a></h3>

The new DATE command does not return to the command prompt.  Instead
the date string is printed each time you press the Enter key.  Use Ctrl-C
To get out of this situation.  Fixed in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b557">557. CPS display in XYZmodem transfers is incorrect</a></h3>

The CPS display in XYZ-modem transfers was broken when floating point
timer support was added in 1.1.16.  Fixed in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b558">558. Problems with SET FILE INCOMPLETE DISCARD</a></h3>

It has been reported that this setting might not work when carrier drops
during a file transfer on a modem connection.  Still under investigation.

<h3><a name="b559">559. Crash during Zmodem download with SET FILE COLLISION RENAME</a></h3>

If SET FILE COLLISION RENAME is active and the incoming file requires
renaming, then after the transfer of the received file is complete K95 can
crash (or produce an unable to free memory error).  Workaround: don't use
the RENAME collision option.  Fixed in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b560">560. TAPI dial gives "invalid call state message" after Busy</a></h3>

When using TAPI MODEM-DIALING and the number is BUSY, the next dial attempt
will fail with an "invalid call state" message.  Fixed in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b561">561. Dead Keys cause <tt>K95.EXE</tt> to terminate in NT</a></h3>

A bug in NT's implementation of the Win32 ToAscii() function causes the
program stack to become corrupted.  This results in <tt>K95.EXE</tt>'s
immediate termination.  A workaround is in 1.1.19.

<h3><a name="b562">562. If PDIAL is used, all subsequent calls are partially dialed</a></h3>

Once a PDIAL command is issued in 1.1.17, all calls from that point forward
will be dialed as partial.  Fixed in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b563">563. HOST.KSC vs. K95 1.1.17</a></h3>

HOST.KSC defines a FAIL macro which conflicts with the FAIL command that was
added in 1.1.17.  This results in two problems:
<p><ol type="a">
<li>If the userid/password combination is invalid throughout      
the retry limit the user will be let on anyway with an        
invalid userid                                                
<p>                                                                  
<li>If the connection is terminated prematurely without a         
proper LOGOUT the script would enter an infinite loop.        
</ol>
<p>                                                                  
To be fixed with an updated HOST.KSC script.  Contact kermit-support if
needed.  Note: whenever a macro name is the same as a built-in command,
the built-in command takes precedence.  To force the macro to be run, rather
than the built-in command, preface it by DO, e.g. "DO FAIL".

<h3><a name="b564">564. Don't tell K95 to RUN 16-bit programs</a></h3>

In Windows 95, any command used in a pipeline must NOT be a 16-bit program,
such as SORT.  If it is, K95 will hang and must be killed from the task
list, and your system will need to be rebooted.  This is a Microsoft Windows
95 bug: a 32-bit program when starting a 16-bit program is unable to
determine when the 16-bit program has terminated.  You can work around this
problem by creating a batch file to start the 16-bit program, and then
RUNning the batch file from K95.
<p>
Note that many 16-bit programs, such as PKZIP/PKUNZIP, are available (or
replacable) by 32-bit equivalants (such as the InfoZIP utilities).  The
32-bit versions give you full access to Windows 95 features such as
long filenames.
<p>
it is always better to run native 32-bit programs under Windows 95.

<h3><a name="b565">565. SET SERVER IDLE-TIMEOUT doesn't timeout</a></h3>

In 1.1.16 and 1.1.17, SET SERVER IDLE-TIMEOUT does not work if the
connection is RELIABLE.  TCP/IP connections default to RELIABLE.
<p>
Workaround:
<p><pre>
  SET RELIABLE OFF
</pre><p>
Fixed in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b566">566. VT Origin mode does not apply to Next Line (ESC E) command</a></h3>

K95 since 1.1.7 has been incorrectly applying the Origin mode to the
Next Line command.  Fixed in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b567">567. PCTERM support not compiled into 1.1.17</a></h3>

Due to a compilation time mixup the PCTERM support was only compiled
into test versions of K95 1.1.17 and was never built into the release
version.  If you need PCTERM support contact
kermit-support@columbia.edu.
Fixed in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b568">568. Using K95 with a NASI modem</a></h3>

Set the NASI Global Settings to always report hardware flow control
to the application.

<h3><a name="b569">569. VT Soft-character-set assignments (NOTE)</a></h3>

As documented, VT soft character-sets are not supported by Kermit 95
due to the limitations of the console environment in which it runs.
K95 tells the host that it does not support soft character-sets when
it is queried.  If the host sends a soft-character-set, it will be
ignored.  If the host attempts to assign the soft-character-set to
G0, G1, G2, or G3, K95 assigns US ASCII, which can be confusing.
In 1.1.18 and later, K95 will do nothing in this situation.

<h3><a name="b570">570. Windows 95/98 DNS Caching results in Kerberos Authentication</a></h3>

<p>
As documented in the Kermit 95 HTML Manual Security section, Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows NT 3.5x, and Microsoft Proxy Server cache DNS entries
without regard to the Time To Live (TTL) value associated with a particular
entry.  The result is that Kerberos authentication fails when attempting to
connect to a hostname that is really an alias for several machines that
provide a similar function.  Microsoft has chosen to issue a private fix
which may be applied to Windows 95 with the Winsock 2.0 update.  The problem
is documented in the Knowledge Base as article Q192425.
<p>
The following directions specify how to receive this fix:
<p><ol type="a">
<li>Ensure that you have a valid product ID for a retail copy of the product
(right-click on 'My Computer', select 'Properties', and use the number
shown beneath the 'Registered to' text).  If you do not have an ID for
a retail copy of Windows 95 (if you have all OEM versions, for example)
there will be a charge of $35 for the support incident.
<p>
<li>Call the appropriate number for 'Standard No-Charge Support:' for 
Microsoft Windows 95:
<p><pre>
  USA:    (425) 635-7000
  Canada: (905) 568-4494
</pre><p>
The best time to call is 8AM-6PM Pacific time (the support escalation
staff is online during these hours)
<p>
You will first talk to a customer service representative (CSR) who
should activate your support, and transfer you to a support engineer.
Please advise the CSR that you need to obtain a specific "hotfix for
Windows 95".
<p>
<li>Once you get to a support engineer, advise him or her of the following:
<p><blockquote>    
You need the hotfix referenced by knowledge base article:
Q192425  Gethostbyaddr() Call with Winsock2 Returns Address Pool Alias.
</blockquote><p>
Hotfix fulfillment is done via an internal escalation team,
which typically does a callback to validate the need for the hotfix.
This is per Microsoft's support policy, and is strictly adhered to.
<p>
The callback typically occurs within 72 business hours from the initial
call-in.

No fixes are available for NT 3.5x,  Proxy Server or Win98 at this time.

<h3><a name="b571">571. TZ environment variable necessary for Kerberos Authentication</a></h3>

Kerberos Authentication relies on clock synchronization to determine when a
Kerberos ticket is valid for use.  All clock times are stored in tickets
in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  The C Run Time Library used the TZ
environment variable to determine the local time zone so it can convert GMT
to local time.  For the Eastern
Time zone of the United States the following must be placed into the
<tt>AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt> file on a Windows 95/98 system or in the System
Environment settings for Windows NT:
<p><pre>
 SET TZ=EST5EDT
</pre><p>
for California:
<p><pre>
 SET TZ=PST8PDT
</pre><p>
Version 1.1.18 defaults to EST5EDT if the TZ variable is not defined.

<h3><a name="b572">572. Word Perfect Keyboard Mode does not work</a></h3>

Even though 1.1.17 allows WP keyboard mode definitions to be assigned
they are never actually used.  Fixed in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b573">573. More about Caps Lock</a></h3>

Sometimes it is possible to get into a truly annoying predicament, in which
Caps Lock is turned on every time you switch from one Console Window (Kermit
95 or any other console application) to another.  No amount of turning Caps
Lock off makes this stop happening.  As noted in
<a href="#b224">Bug #224</a>, this is a Microsoft
bug in Windows 95 (and 98?) but not NT.  Here is a workaround: Switch to a GUI
window and turn off Caps Lock there.  Now your console windows are back to
normal.

<h3><a name="b574">574. CONNECT /TRIGGER causes memory exception in OS/2</a></h3>

The second attempt to enter CONNECT mode with a trigger will result in
a memory exception.  Fixed in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b575">575. "NO CARRIER", SET CARRIER-WATCH, INPUT and Hayes High-Speed Modems</a></h3>

If you are using the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A Hayes High Speed modem (V.32bis or higher) with ATE1 set
<li>SET CARRIER-WATCH ON or AUTO
<li>A script using a loop containing INPUT <i>secs</i> to read one character 
at a time into \v(inchar) which then either echos the character or
OUTPUTs some other data.
</ul>
<p>
When the modem loses the carrier signal, it will output the string 
"NO CARRIER" and then drop the carrier signal.  However, because there
is data waiting to be processed the INPUT command succeeds and does
not detect the carrier loss.  Since the modem is now in the command state
it will echo data sent to it (because of ATE1) causing an infinite loop.
To detect the lost connection, add a WAIT 0 CD command followed by IF
FAILURE to the loop.

<h3><a name="b576">576. Install of K95 1.1.17 on Alpha does not perform registration</a></h3>

The program receives an "Out of Memory" error and terminates.

<h3><a name="b577">577. Televideo terminals enter infinite loop when using Block mode</a></h3>

Block mode was never implemented for the Televideo terminals in
K95 1.1.17.  This capability has been added to version 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b578">578. SNI 97801 terminal emulation bugs</a></h3>

K95 1.1.17 would improperly handle a scroll region larger than the
display size and direct cursor addressing to the status line.  This is 
corrected in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b579">579. K95 Telnet can crash if remote host crashes</a></h3>

Observed on Windows 95B during file transfer over a Telnet session to
VAX/VMS 7.1 with MultiNet 4.0B.  K95 crashes when remote host crashes.
Windows crash dialog box says:
<p><pre>
  K95 caused a stack fault in module WSOCK32.DLL at 0157:7c6ca4b8.
</pre><p>
Stack dump shows all 0's.  Winsock bug.

<h3><a name="b580">580. K95 prints double characters when Copy Print mode is used</a></h3>

ASCII terminal emulations such as Wyse, Televideo and DataGeneral
have a Copy to Printer mode which prints each and every character
that is sent to the terminal display.  This mode on ASCII terminals
will print double characters in 1.1.17.  Fixed in 1.1.18.

<h3><a name="b581">581. REMOTE {SET, ASSIGN, RENAME, COPY} do not return to CONNECT mode</a></h3>

When a REMOTE {SET, ASSIGN, RENAME, COPY} command is processed by 
CONNECT mode it leaves the user at the command prompt instead of
returning automatically to CONNECT mode as it should.  Fixed in 1.1.19.

<h3><a name="b582">582. Incoming TAPI calls may result in K95 crashes during file sends</a></h3>

When the following conditions are true file sends may result in a K95
crash due to an "invalid access" error:
<p><pre>
  SET TAPI MODEM-DIALING OFF
  SET TAPI LINE <i>device</i>
  SET WIN95 OVERLAPPED-I/O ON
  SET FLOW not specified to match that used by the modem
</pre><p>
The problem is that when the TAPI device is allocated the transmit
buffers are not properly allocated.  Fixed in 1.1.19.

<h3><a name="b583">583. Kermit/2 1.1.17 SERVER does not return from REMOTE HOST commands</a></h3>

(OS/2 only) When the SERVER receives a REMOTE HOST command it does not
correctly pass the command to be executed to the command shell.  
A workaround.  If you know you are communicating to OS/2 K95 version 
1.1.17, send the command to be executed as  
<p><pre>
   REMOTE HOST /c <command>
</pre><p>
instead of

  REMOTE HOST <command>
</pre><p>
Fixed in 1.1.19.

<h3><a name="b584">584. Transparent-print error if CSI received when remote character set is a code page</a></h3>

PC Code Pages are not compatible with international standards for 
character sets.  Code Pages place printable characters in the range
allocated for the C1 control characters.  The C1 control character CSI
(0x9B) is the equivalent of ESC [.  When performing transparent printing
the emulator must process CSI sequences to look for CSI 4 i to determine 
when printing should terminate.  However, with code pages the code point
0x9B should not be treated as CSI because it is a printable character.
1.1.17 forgot to treat 0x9B as a printable character when performing
transparent printing.  This is corrected in 1.1.19.

<h3><a name="b585">585. MIT Kerberos 2.0 K5 support disables K95 telnet authentication</a></h3>

K95 1.1.17 has a bug that will result in all telnet authentication 
being disabled if it finds Kebreros 5 libraries but cannot successfully
load all of the necessary functions.
<p>
This problem is fixed in K95 1.1.19.

<h3><a name="b586">586. SRP support fails to authenticate against SRP 1.5.0 Telnetd</a></h3>

K95 1.1.17 was designed to work with SRP 1.4.1 and simultaneously
be compatible with the most up to date IETF Internet Draft on Telnet
Authentication.  SRP's Telnet Authentication did not adhere to the
Internet Draft.  The SRP Telnet authentication handshake did not
protect against a man in the middle attack which would allow 
authentication to succeed and encryption to be disabled.  In the 
process of fixing this security hole the SRP Telnet authentication
handshake was altered.  In the process it broke compatibility with
Kermit 95 1.1.17's implementation of telnet authentication.
<p>
If you are connecting to a host that uses SRP 1.5.0 Telnetd you
will not be able to authenticate using K95 1.1.17.  K95 1.1.19
is compatible with SRP 1.5.0.

<h3><a name="b587">587. K95 1.1.17 breaks Host-Mode Script</a></h3>

Kermit 95 1.1.17 included a new FAIL command, which conflicted with the
FAIL macro that was defined and used in <tt>HOST.KSC</tt>.  Shortly after
K95 1.1.17 was released, a corrected version of the host-mode script was
put on the Kermit FTP site and downloaded by most people who used host mode.
Unfortunately, this means that <tt>HOST.KSC</tt> will not be updated in the
1.1.19 patch.  If you downloaded the fixed <tt>HOST.KSC</tt> file for
K95 1.1.17 and then installed the 1.1.19 patch, you'll need to download the
1.1.19 version of <tt>HOST.KSC</tt> after installing the patch:
<p><pre>
  <a href="ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/k95/host.ksc">ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/k95/host.ksc</a>
</pre>

<h3><a name="b588">588. K95 and Host-Mode Script versions must agree</a></h3>

<i>(Not a bug.)</i> If you attempt to run old host-mode scripts with a newer
version of Kermit 95, they are likely not to work.  For example, the way
Telnet negotiations are handled changed in K95 1.1.19, and the
<tt>HOST.KSC</tt> and <tt>HOSTTCP.KSC</tt> scripts were modified accordingly.
The new scripts are likely to fail with syntax errors under older K95
versions, and old scripts are likely to hang under the new K95 version.  The
host-mode scripts are updated automatically when you install an upgrade patch
UNLESS YOU CHANGED THEM.  Modified files are not, and can not be, patched.  In
this case, you can download the current scripts from the Kermit FTP site (<a
href="#b587">previous item</a>).

<h3><a name="b589">589. TAKE command arguments are persistent</a></h3>

A new feature in K95 1.1.19 and C-Kermit 7.0 is the ability to include
parameters for command files on the TAKE command line, documented
in <a href="ckermi70.html#x7.16">Section 7.16</a> of the C-Kermit 7.0 Update
Notes.  As noted there, any arguments you give to a TAKE command are
persistent.  This can produce surprising results with subsequent TAKE
commands.  For example:
<p><pre>
  K-95&#62; <u>take foo.ksc <i>arg1 arg2 ...</i></u>
  K-95&#62; <u>take bar.ksc</u>
</pre><p>
The second command file, <tt>bar.ksc</tt>, receives the same arguments as the
first.  This is not a bug, exactly, but it's not good either.  Future releases
of C-Kermit and K95 are likely to change this behavior, so don't depend on it.
In the meantime, you can work around any problems caused by the current
arrangement (e.g. when the second TAKE file refers to <tt>\%1</tt>,
<tt>\%2</tt>, etc, but you don't include arguments when TAKE'ing it) by
explicitly clearing the affected variables:
<p><pre>
  K-95&#62; <u>take foo.ksc <i>arg1 arg2 ...</i></u>
  K-95&#62; <u>undef \%1</u>
  K-95&#62; <u>undef \%2</u>
  ...
  K-95&#62; <u>take bar.ksc</u>
</pre>

<h3><a name="b590">590. Title-Bar Close box [x] doesn't work in Win9x</a></h3>

It never did.  Console applications do not receive a Close message from
Windows 9x when you click the Close [x] box.  The application is terminated
abruptly by Windows, leaving all its resources (such as the TAPI device)
in an indeterminate state, and Windows itself unstable until the next reboot.
In K95 1.1.19, a method was found to disable the Close [x] box to prevent
this from happening; the [x] box is simply grayed out and inoperative.  Since
it is not possible to receive a message when the user clicks this box, there
is no way to issue a warning or give instructions on the proper way to exit
K95.

<p>

A secondary problem with the disabled Close box is that it remains disabled
even after K95 exits.  You will notice this only if you start K95 from an
MS-DOS Command window.  Terminate the MS-DOS Command window with an EXIT
command at the DOS prompt, or with Ctrl-Alt-Del.

<h3><a name="b591">591. VT102 emulation broken in 1.1.19</a></h3>

K95 Bug.  Workaround: Use VT220 and specify VT102 as the Telnet terminal
type if VT102 must be used.  Fixed in 1.1.120.

<h3><a name="b592">592. Failure to make certain Telnet connections</a></h3>

K95 1.1.19 is stricter about enforcing Telnet protocol rules than previous
releases, and therefore might fail to make connections with faulty servers
when previous releases could do so.  In most cases, the old behavior can
be restored by including the /NOWAIT switch in your TELNET or SET HOST
command, or (globally) with SET TELNET WAIT OFF.  See
<a href="http://kermitproject.org/telnet.html">http://kermitproject.org/telnet.html</a>
for details.

<h3><a name="b593">593. Faulty OS/2 Dialer Patch for K95 1.1.19</a></h3>

After applying the 1.1.19 upgrade patch to OS/2 Kermit 95, the OS/2 Dialer
was corrupting the <tt>DIALUSR.DAT</tt> user database.  This was fixed by
replacing the OS/2 patch for 1.1.19 and notifying the affecting users.

<h3><a name="b594">594. LOGIN.KSC didn't work without the Dialer</a></h3>

There was a typo in the <tt>LOGIN.KSC</tt> file that prevented its use when
not used in conjunction with the dialer.  Fixed in 1.1.20.

<h3><a name="b595">595. C1 Printable characters of non-ISO-2022 character sets </a></h3>

Code Page character sets have printable characters in the C1 range.  These
characters are misinterpreted when they are printed in the rightmost column of
VT terminal emulations.  Fixed in 1.1.20.

<h3><a name="b596">596. IBM 3151 attributes </a></h3>

IBM 3151 attributes can be applied as bitmasks with replacement, bitwise OR
and bitwise AND operations.  Kermit was treating all attributes as
replacement.  Fixed in 1.1.20.

<h3><a name="b597">597. OpenSSL requires the PRNG to be seeded.</a></h3>

K95 did not properly seed the PRNG.  Fixed in 1.1.20 along with an upgrade to
OpenSSL 0.9.5a (Win32 only; OS/2 is still using 0.9.4).

<h3><a name="b598">598. Kerberos support not compatible with NRL SecureID support</a></h3>

The NRL Kerberos DLLs use a slightly different interface than the MIT DLLs
upon which they are based.  1.1.20 supports both interfaces and specifically
supports the NRL distribution.

<h3><a name="b599">599. MAIL command does not work</a></h3>

The address field of the MAIL command was lost during parsing.  Fixed in
1.1.20.

<h3><a name="b600">600. SEND <tt>..\\*.c</tt> fails with "unreadable error"</a></h3>

Workaround: <tt>send ../*.c</tt>.  Fixed in 1.1.20

<h3><a name="b601">601.  LOCAL and global variable name conflicts</a></h3>

In a macro, if a variable "abc" was declared LOCAL when there was
an existing global variable "abcdef" the following side effects
were observed:
<p><ul>
<li>The global variable would be deleted when the macro was executed.
<li>The local variable would become global upon macro termination
and would be assigned the value of the deleted global.
</ul>
<p>
Fixed in 1.1.20.

<h3><a name="b602">602.  Kerberos password prompts versus <tt>-# 96</tt> startup option</a></h3>

Kerberos password prompts were being displayed in popups when K95 was started
with the <tt>-# 96</tt> command-line option (use standard input/output),
even though popups do not work when K95 is instructed to use standard i/o.
Fixed in 1.1.20

<h3><a name="b603">603. ANSWER 0 improperly times out</a></h3>

The ANSWER command with a timeout value of 0 is supposed to wait forever for a
call.  Instead, it was timing out after 254 seconds.  Fixed in 1.1.20.

<h3><a name="b604">604. ANSWER fails to answer call with SET TAPI MODEM-DIALING ON</a></h3>

If a TAPI device was being used with TAPI Modem-Dialing set to ON, the ANSWER
command would fail to answer the call reporting "Operation Unavailable".  This
is due to a change in behavior of newer TAPI service providers.  Fixed in
1.1.20.

<h3><a name="b605">605. RLOGIN Window Size reports are not sent</a></h3>

1.1.19 did not send Rlogin Window Size reports.  Fixed in 1.1.20.

<h3><a name="b606">606. Pulse dialing did not work</a></h3>

Kermit provides a method for automatically determining by country code whether
Pulse or Tone dialing should be used by default.  K95 1.1.19 had bug resulting
in the automatic mode not being overridden by explicit SET DIAL METHOD PULSE
or TONE commands.  This more often than not results in Tone dialing being used
under all circumstances in country codes:
<p><blockquote>
1 31 32 33 352 353 354 358 39 44 45 46 47 49
</blockquote><p>
Fixed in 1.1.20.

<h3><a name="b607">607. AUTH K5 INIT /NO-ADDRESSES may crash Kermit 95</a></h3>

There is a bug in the MIT Kerberos for Microsoft Operating Systems Release 2.0
which will result in a crash of Kermit 95 if the new /NO-ADDRESSES switch is
used to retrieve tickets without embedded IP addresses.  The problem (and a
fix) has been submitted to MIT for inclusion in the next release.

<h3><a name="b608">608. RLOGIN protocol (and secure variations) does not work in 1.1.20</a></h3>

The previous fix to RLOGIN window size notifications (bug 605) 
appears to have made things worse.  Fixed in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b609">609. Kerberos 5 NT Alpha 2 and previous releases do not work with 1.1.20</a></h3>

The prerelease versions of the Kerberos 5 libraries do not work with the
initial release of 1.1.20 as they are missing necessary functionality to
support the AUTH K5 INIT /NO-ADDRESSES and Hardware Pre-auth functionality.
It was not intentional that older releases should no longer be usable.  A
future patch may restore this functionality with the limitations that
/NO-ADDRESSES and Hardware Preauth cannot be used.

<h3><a name="b610">610. SET FILE DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY leads to unexpected bahavior</a></h3>

The SET FILE DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY command when issued without a directory name
could lead to very unexpected results.  Instead, of clearing the
download-directory it would assign a directory of the null-string.  How this
causes Kermit to behave is unpredictable.  This was fixed in 1.1.20.

<h3><a name="b611">611. HOSTMODE scripts updated</a></h3>

The HOSTMODE scripts for 1.1.20 might not be able to find either the k95.exe
executable or the host.cfg file depending on how it is started.  Please

<h3><a name="b612">612. Telnet Forward-X option negotiated even when an X Server not found</a></h3>

If the telnet server requests the use of Forward-X, K95 negotiates it
even though it can't find an X Windows Server.  This could lead to dual
mode programs such as emacs to attempt to open an X Display when a
display does not exist.  To be fixed in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b613">613. Wyse 60 keyboard definitions are incorrect </a></h3>

The table of default keyboard definitions used to initialize the
strings sent by Wyse keyboard verbs is incorrect for all keys 
other than F1 to F16.  These values are used both for initial
key assignment and when resetting the key values under host command.
Fixed in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b614">614. <tt>\v(krb5errno)</tt> and <tt>\v(krb5errmsg)</tt> do not report all errors</a></h3>

The krb5 kermit variables report the status of the last kerberos 5
library call.  After some errors occur, other kerberos 5 library
calls are made that clear the error values.  Corrected in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b615">615. The Dialer does not support <tt>%ENVVAR%</tt> expansion of file names</a></h3>

The names used in fields for file names do not support the <tt>%ENVVAR%</tt>
style environment variable expansion used in the <tt>.BAT</tt> batch files.
Not only does this notation not work in Kermit 95 but it can cause the dialer
to perform a fatal exception.  Fixed in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b616">616. How to debug SET PRINTER configurations in Windows</a></h3>

The SET PRINTER command has evolved since the introduction of Kermit 95
in October 1995.  The original SET PRINTER command was extremely simple:
<p>
<pre>
  SET PRINTER <i>dos-name</i>
</pre>
<p>

where <i>dos-name</i> could be any filename or device name that could be
opened via the C run time library fopen() call.  By the time 1.1.17 was
released the SET PRINTER command had been modified to support piped commands,
windows printer queues, and numerous configuration values for timeouts,
bidirectional printing, ...  The problem with 1.1.17 was that if you wanted to
change the printer timeout value you would need to re-enter the entire SET
PRINTER command line to respecify all of the other configuration values.

<p>

So in 1.1.18 and higher, the SET PRINTER command switches are sticky.
This means you can now issue a sequence of commands such as

<p>
<pre>
  SET PRINTER /WINDOWS-QUEUE:            ; or /WINDOWS: or /WIN: or /W:
  SET PRINTER /TIMEOUT:300
  SET PRINTER /END-OF-JOB-STRING:\12
</pre>
<p>

instead of combining them all on a single line.  This is wonderful except that
there is now confusion when using a mixture of commands.  The help text for
SET PRINTER states:

<p>
<blockquote>

If you give a printer name without specifying any of these switches, then it
is assumed to be a DOS printer device or filename unless the name given (after
removing enclosing braces, if any) starts with '|', in which case it is a
pipe.

</blockquote>
<p>

but the following sequence (in 1.1.18 through 1.1.20):

<p>
<pre>
  SET PRINTER /WINDOWS-QUEUE:
  SET PRINTER PRN:
</pre>
<p>

does not "choose the default windows printer queue" and then "choose the DOS
device PRN:".  Instead this sequence is treated equivalent to

<p>
<pre>
  SET PRINTER /WINDOWS-QUEUE PRN:
</pre>
<p>

which results in an invalid printer configuration since there is no windows
printer queue with the name "<tt>PRN:</tt>".  Not that this should be allowed
either because "<tt>PRN:</tt>" is not a valid printer queue and K95 should
detect that (but it does not.)

<p>

This situation becomes a problem when there is a mixture of SET PRINTER
commands from a variety of sources: <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> file, the Dialer
Connection Script, and a keymap or login script taken by the Connection
Script.  For instance, if the <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> file has a:

<p>
<pre>
  SET PRINTER /WINDOWS-QUEUE:
</pre>
<p>

command which selects the default Windows Printer Queue and a subsequent
script contains a 

<p>
<pre>
  SET PRINTER LPT1:
</pre>
<p>

command using the old format, the result is a printer
configuration that does not work.

<p>

If printing does not work when you expect that it should, use the:

<p>
<pre>
  SHOW PRINTER
</pre>
<p>

command to examine the current configuration.  If it looks like:

<p>
<pre>
  [D:/kermit/src/] C-Kermit&gt; <u>sh print</u>
  Printer: prn:
   /OUTPUT-ONLY
   /WINDOWS-QUEUE
   /TIMEOUT:0
   /END-OF-JOB-STRING:(none)
   /JOB-HEADER-FILE:(none)
</pre>
<p>

where the printer name is correct but it is not a Windows Queue
and yet the /WINDOWS-QUEUE flag is set; it means that you need
to use the command form

<p>
<pre>
  SET PRINTER /DOS-DEVICE:name
</pre>
<p>

when setting the printer.  Track down the script which contains 
the:

<p>
<pre>
  SET PRINTER name
</pre>
<p>

command and update it.

Version 1.1.21 restores the proper functionality of the:

<p>
<pre>
  SET PRINTER <i>name</i>
</pre>
<p>

form of the command and also confirms the validity of the name if
it is a Windows Printer Queue.

<p>

It should also be noted that the text describing the SET PRINTER
command in the K95 HTML manual is a bit confusing because it 
describes the printer type switches as have the format

<p>
<pre>
   SET PRINTER /WINDOWS-QUEUE[:<name>] 
</pre>
<p>

when it should be described as:

<p>
<pre>
   SET PRINTER /WINDOWS-QUEUE[:[<name>]]
</pre>
<p>

where providing the colon without a name implies the default printer
name of the given type. 

<h3><a name="b617">617.  RLOGIN <i>host userid</i> fails to send <i>userid</i> to <i>host</i></a></h3>

The <i>userid</i> field on the RLOGIN command is supposed to allow the
specification of an alternate name to use on the remote host.
Rlogin sends both the local and the remote names to the host.  In
all versions of K95 after 1.1.17 the names are swapped.  

<p>

RLOGIN /K5 does not allow the <i>userid</i> to be input.

<p>

This is fixed in 1.1.21.  

<h3><a name="b618">618.  -M command-line option does not work</a></h3>

The -M option is supposed to allow you to assign an alternate 
userid (SET LOGIN USER name) from the command line.  This switch
has no effect in 1.1.18 to 1.1.20.  To be fixed in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b619">619.  \v(exedir), \v(startupdir), \v(inidir) results can contain spaces</a></h3>

Not really a bug.  Spaces in path names are very hard to work with in
scripting languages that use whitespace as token separators.  Windows provides
a mechanism to determine the short names for a given path.  In 1.1.21 and
greater these variables always use the short names instead of the long names,
and new functions, <tt>\flongpathname()</tt> and <tt>\fshortpathname()</tt>,
are provided to convert between the two forms.

<h3><a name="b620">620. Kermit 95 does not accept keyboard input on CJK Windows 95/98</a></h3>

CJK versions of Windows 95/98 do not (by default) install an Input Locale
which supports any of the Latin Code Pages (CP 1250-1258).  Since the Windows
95/98 Console mode does not support Unicode K95 must perform translations of
all keyboard events to one of the Latin Code Pages.  Without a translation
table all keyboard events return error values and K95 is unable to process
keyboard input.

<p>

In 1.1.20 and earlier, if an Input Locale for English, German, French,
... is installed it will still appear that input cannot be processed
since the default Input Locale (CJK) does not include the Latin 
alphabet.  Pressing Left Alt-Shift one or more times until the Latin
language Input Locale is selected allows for proper processing of
keyboard input.  1.1.21 and later support the following behavior:

<ul>

<li>K95 tests each installed Input Locale until it finds one that is able to
translate the letter 'a', at which time it stops and uses that Input Locale as
the default for the session.

<p>

<li>if no input locales are available that can translate the letter 'a',
Kermit 95 terminates with an error message stating that an Input Locale must
be installed.

<p>

<li>K95 performs this test only if a user presses a key.  This way if K95 is
being run from a script or using stdin the test is never performed.

</ul>

<h3><a name="b621">621. QNX terminal emulation keypad-Plus and -Minus keys do not transmit "+" and "-"</a></h3>

This is a design decision, not a bug.  The QNX operating system toggles the
value of the Keypad-Plus and Keypad-Minus keys when the NumLock key is
pressed; Windows does not.  Therefore, the keys can only have one of the two
assignments.  K95 uses the assignments recommended by Dan Hildebrand of QNX in
his document "Terminal Control under QNX" dated Nov 14, 1991.

<p>

The default mapping is to assign the SELECT function to Keypad-Plus
and CANCEL to Keypad-Minus:

<p>
<pre>
  SET TERM KEY QNX /LITERAL \363 \{255}\{167}     ; SELECT
  SET TERM KEY QNX /LITERAL \365 \{255}\{163}     ; CANCEL
</pre>
<p>

and to leave the "+" and "-" strings assigned to the Shifted keys:

<p>
<pre>
  SET TERM KEY QNX \875 \{43}
  SET TERM KEY QNX \877 \{45}
</pre>
<p>

These mappings can be reversed by adding the following to the
K95CUSTOM.INI file:

<p>
<pre>
  SET TERM KEY QNX /LITERAL \875 \{255}\{167}
  SET TERM KEY QNX /LITERAL \877 \{255}\{163}
  SET TERM KEY QNX \363 \{43}
  SET TERM KEY QNX \365 \{45}
</pre>

<h3><a name="b622">622.  IBM 3151 unable to restore ASCII character set after Graphics character set is used</a></h3>

The IBM 3151 is a 7-bit terminal with two character set storage areas.
Both are set to ASCII by default.  Once a storage area has been set
to the Graphics character set, it cannot be restored to ASCII.

<h3><a name="b623">623.  TYPE and TRANSLATE commands only work under specific circumstances</a></h3>

One of Kermit's strengths is its ability to handle translations between
character-sets.  With the release of 1.1.19 (and 1.1.20) we altered the
program to use Unicode (UCS2) as the intermediate character set for all
translations.  Unlike traditional character-sets UCS2 requires that its data
be represented in 16-bits instead of 8-bits.  While this allows UCS2 to be the
perfect intermediary character set since it includes all the characters in all
other character sets the use of 16-bits means that the representation of the
character in memory becomes dependent on the byte ordering of the underlying
computer architecture: Big-Endian or Little-Endian.  When the byte orders
become confused translations give bad results.

<p>

In 1.1.20 the TYPE command can be used for ascii text but cannot
be used to display text in alternative character sets such as UTF-8,
UCS2, or files from other platforms.

<p>

In 1.1.20 the TRANSLATE command can be used to display files of
any type to the display, but due to byte ordering issues it cannot
be used to actually perform a translation without using a work around.
The command

<p>
<pre>
  translate <i>infile incs outcs outfile</i>
</pre>
<p>

results in garbage.  To get this to work in 1.1.20 you need to
temporarily alter the byte ordering 

<p>
<pre>
  set file ucs byte-order big-endian
  translate filename hp-roman8 cp1252 newfilename
  set file ucs byte-order little-endian
</pre>
<p>

This is fixed in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b624">624.  1.1.20 is incompatible with Services for Unix 2.0 Telnet Server</a></h3>

If you are using K95 to access the SFU v2 Telnet Server, do not use

<h3><a name="b625">625.  Wheel Mouse Button Numbering</a></h3>

If you have a wheel mouse, the numbering of the buttons might not be what you
expect.  For example, the left button might be button 3 and the wheel might be
button 2.  Some wheel mice allow the wheel to be clicked (or double clicked).
Since the default assignment for the \Kpaste verb is Mouse Button 2
Double-Click, users of wheel mice might need to change this assignment if they
want it to apply to the left mouse button.  If your Control Panel has a Test
Mouse feature, you can use it to find out what the button assignments are.

Boxes, etc.  The Dialer's Edit Dialog in 1.1.20 contain over 300 window
objects and requires 23k of memory.  If this much memory is not available, a
GPF occurs.  Fixed in 1.1.21.


<h3><a name="b628">628.  K95 crashes on Windows 95 if SECUR32.DLL is missing </a></h3>

Windows 95/98 come with <tt>SECUR32.DLL</tt> to provide the Security Support
Provider Interface.  This is a standard part of the Windows API.  If this file
is missing, <tt>K95.EXE</tt> crashes upon startup.  Fixed in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b629">629.  K95 Dialer 1.1.20 dialer produces non-fatal GPF on startup</a></h3>

On a small number of Windows 95 systems it has been reported that there is a
non-fatal GPF produced in <tt>KERNEL32.DLL</tt> when the Dialer is started.
This has been traced to a defect in some versions of <tt>IPHLPAPI.DLL</tt>.
One known version of the DLL with the problem is version 5.00.1952.1.  You can
download a newer version of the DLL that does not suffer the problem from

<p>
<pre>
  <a href="ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/k95/iphlpapi.dll">ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/k95/iphlpapi.dll</a>
</pre>
<p>

Either replace the file located at <tt>\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\IPHLPAPI.DLL</tt> with
this newer version or place the file in the K95 directory.

<h3><a name="b630">630.  Printer device not closed (if open) when K95 exits</a></h3>

If K95 has a printer open when it terminates, the printer is not closed.  When
printing to a file, this can result in the print output being truncated.
Fixed in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b631">631.  Winmodems</a></h3>

We've said it before and we'll say it again: Winmodems should not be relied
upon for any serious work.  For testing new dialin modem pool banks at
Columbia, we have a script that repeatedly dials, logs in, uploads and
downloads a 100K ZIP file, logs out, and hangs up.  When this script is used
with a Winmodem, the rate at which successful calls were disconnected before
the data transfer phase was complete was about 13% (1700 trials).  The same
script run with an equivalent external (real) modem on the same PC encountered
zero (0) disconnections.  Furthermore, when Winmodems are in use, they can
impact your PC's performance in ways that an external modem can not: Windows
freezes periodically; the keyboard buffer is scrambled, etc.

<h3><a name="b632">632.  SRP client security hole discovered</a></h3>

A bug in the SRP client library that opens SRP to attack by a fraudulent
server has been discovered.  This is not a deficiency in the SRP
authentication protocol but a programming error in the library which has been
fixed as of SRP release 1.7.0.  The fix for this release is incorporated
into the 1.1.21 release of K95.

<h3><a name="b633">633.  K95 Documentation Shortcut to bugs file is incorrect</a></h3>

The Start Menu shortcut for the Bugs file is created for the file named
bugs.htm and not k95bugs.htm as it should be.

<h3><a name="b634">634.  UPDATES.HTM file has wrong version number</a></h3>

The 1.1.19 version of <tt>UPDATES.HTM</tt> did not get updated for 1.1.20.
1.1.20 added:

<ul>
<li>Kerberos 5 user to user authentication
<li>support for NRL Kerberos 5
</ul>

<h3><a name="b635">635.  K95 Linux Console emulation incompatible with Red Hat 7.x AND all other new Linux distributions</a></h3>

Due to changes to the definition of Linux Console in the Linux Kernel built
into Red Hat 7.0 and later, the K95 Linux console implementation cannot be
used with 'vi' and perhaps other applications.  This is corrected in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b636">636.  Buffer overflow caused by long modem response messages</a></h3>

It was found that a modem response message greater than or equal to 128 bytes
in length causes a buffer overflow in K95 versions released over the last
several years.  This is corrected in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b637">637.  Failures when connecting through SOCKS server takes too long</a></h3>

If a SOCKS server is being used, and the SOCKS server has multiple IP
addresses, and access to the desired host is denied or otherwise unavailable,
then K95 would attempt to connect the SOCKS server's alternate IP addresses as
if they belonged to the desired host.  This is fixed in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b638">638.  Can't start K95 from a DOS Prompt or from with a DOS application</a></h3>

If you can't start <tt>K95.EXE</tt> from within a DOS Prompt or a DOS
application it is most likely because that session is configured to prevent
it.  See:

<p>
<pre>
  Cannot Start a Windows-Based Program from MS-DOS Prompt
  <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q134/4/89.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q134/4/89.asp</a>
</pre>
<p>

Apparently, some versions of Windows 98 Second Edition have the:

<p>
<pre>
  [x] Prevent MS-DOS based programs from detecting Windows?
</pre>
<p>

flag set in the <tt>_Default.PIF</tt> configuration program.  The bizarre
side-effect of this is that our SETUP.EXE program which is 32-bits cannot
start sub-processes (e.g. <tt>K95PACK.EXE</tt>) because <tt>COMMAND.COM</tt>
is executed by the <tt>system()</tt> API, and <tt>COMMAND.COM</tt> is an
MS-DOS based program.

<h3><a name="b639">639.  K95.EXE when started from dialer complains about invalid command line parameters (Windows 2000/XP)</a></h3>

The K95 Dialer uses the TEMP or TMP variables to determine where to create the
temporary connection scripts used by <tt>K95.EXE</tt> to connect to a host.
If the path contains spaces a command line of the form:

<p>
<pre>
  k95.exe c:\temp path\script.ksc
</pre>
<p>

is created.  Since the filename is not surrounded by quotes <tt>K95.EXE</tt>
treats the command line as two parameters; one of which is illegal.  This is
fixed in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b640">640.  K95D.EXE stops accepting new connections after several hundred or thousand incoming connections</a></h3>

<tt>K95D.EXE</tt> contains a resource leak.  Handles to the Process and
primary thread spawned when starting <tt>K95.EXE</tt> were never closed.
Windows eventually runs out of Handles or Process space.  This prevents
additional <tt>K95.EXE</tt> sessions from being spawned until the
<tt>K95D.EXE</tt> process is shutdown and restarted.

<h3><a name="b641">641.  SET FILE COLLISION BACKUP fails on some file names but not others</a></h3>

On Windows 95/98/ME, there is a strange behavior in the <tt>CreateFile()</tt>
API when given the OPEN_ALWAYS flag.  It is supposed to return
ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS when the file exists.  Unfortunately, this is not always
the case.  When this bug is triggered, the file being received has
both an original and backup file created, both empty.  Fixed in 1.1.21, by
no longer relying on the documented behavior.

<h3><a name="b642">642.  SET TAPI MODEM-DIALING ON can cause scripting to fail</a></h3>

A just-discovered bug which has been present since version 1.1.3 can result in
scripting commands such as INPUT and OUTPUT to fail if a SET SPEED command was
not executed after the SET TAPI LINE which opened the device.  This is fixed
in 1.1.21.

<h3><a name="b643">643.  Dialer direct-serial configurations vs. Hardware Parity</a></h3>

The Dialer, when configured to use a direct serial connection, fails to output
SET STOP-BITS defaulting to 1 and also fails to output SET PARITY if the
setting is "Even_8Bytes", "Odd_8bytes", "Mark_8bytes", "Space_8bytes".

<h3><a name="b644">644.  Windows XP default location causes K95.EXE to crash on startup</a></h3>

In Windows XP, the default location is not fully specified to the application.
<tt>K95.EXE</tt> 1.1.20 and earlier do not check for an incomplete location
and crash on startup if one is found.  This bug is fixed in 1.1.21.
Workaround: Use the "Phone and Modem Options" control panel item to create a
location.

<h3><a name="b645">645.  Ghost Character Fragments on NT/2000/XP Console Screen</a></h3>

When using certain fonts in Windows NT, 2000, or XP in the Console version of
Kermit 95, character bits and pieces can be left behind when a cell is
cleared, especially if the cell was highlighted and was adjacent to a block
cursor (as often happens with Unix <i>more</i>, <i>Lynx</i>, or various news
readers), or if it has been selected with the mouse.  This has been observed
consistently, for example, with the Lucida Console font in Windows XP.  It's a
Windows problem.  Workaround: to clear the ghost fragments, type Alt-x twice
in a row.  To avoid the problem, pick a different font.  This won't happen in
the GUI version.

<h3><a name="b646">646.  The Kermit Timesync Utility Might Not Work</a></h3>

<tt>TIMESYNC.EXE</tt> uses RFC868 Time protocol (1983).  Increasingly,
however, Internet time servers are shifting to Network Time Protocol (NTP,
the topic of about twelve RFCs from 1985 to the present: see <a
href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/index.html">http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/index.html</a>,
which is a web site maintained by the authors of NTP for recommendations and
software for synchronizing their clocks.  Windows XP supports NTP as part of
its "Date and Time Properties" control panel.  See the "Internet Time" for the
ability to "Automatically synchronize with an Internet Time Server" or "Update
Now".  Custom servers may be specified.

<h3><a name="b647">647. Unbalanced-Braces Error in Scripts</a></h3>

The following:

<p>
<pre>
  define Bob {
      for \%i 1 1 1 {
          output \{13}
      }
  }
  do Bob
</pre>
<p>

gets an "unbalanced braces" error (because of the quoted backslash).
Workaround: avoid <tt>\{nnn}</tt> notation for characters inside brace-enclosed
loops.  Fixed in version 2.0.

<h3><a name="b648">648. Disappearing Cursor</a></h3>

For some people, under certain as-yet unknown circumstances, the terminal
screen cursor can disappear.  This is not a new problem, but we have never
been able to identify a scenario to reproduce it.  Workaround: two Alt-X's in
a row to exit and reenter the terminal emulator, or do anything that would
resize the terminal window.  If you can give us a sequence of events that
reliably reproduces this problem (or if we find one ourselves), we can fix it.

<h3><a name="b649">649. Escape Character Status Line Typo</a></h3>

The termininal-screen screen status looks like this if you type the
CONNECT-mode escape character
<p>
<pre>
 ESCAPE         Command:        Prompt: c     Help: h
</pre>
<p>
It should say "Command Prompt: c" instead of "Command:   Prompt: c".

<h3><a name="b650">650. Status Line Not Updated after Ctrl-] Ctrl-]</a></h3>

If, after typing the CONNECT-mode escape character, you type a second copy of
the escape character, the terminal-screen status line is not restored.  Fixed
in version 2.0 Workaround: Use Alt-R to reset the emulator.

<h3><a name="b651">651. HELP REMOTE HOST text wrong</a></h3>

"help remote host" says synonym is RHELP instead of RHOST.
Fixed in version 2.0.

<h3><a name="b652">652. SET COMMAND SCROLLBACK in a script can cause an invalid memory access</a></h3>

Fixed in 2.0.

<h3><a name="b653">653. Kerberos 5 Rlogin fails to authenticate</a></h3>

Apparently this has been broken through the entire 1.1.20 release period
and no one ever complained.  It's funny what a single missing colon can do
in a protocol message.  Fixed in version 2.0.

<h3><a name="b654">654. Dialer bugs:</a></h3>

There should not be a browse button for the TLS Ciphers field.

The TLS Settings page cannot be used with FTP connections even
though K95 supports SSL/TLS secured FTP sessions.

The paths generated with the Browse buttons should use forward
slashes instead of the traditional backslashes found on Windows.

These are fixed version 2.0.

<h3><a name="b655">655.  telnet.exe and rlogin.exe do not work</a></h3>

Both commands incorrectly generate the new k95.exe command line.
Fixed in version 2.0.

<h3><a name="b656">656.  Telnet ComPort option</a></h3>

Dialing does not work consistently when carrier detect watching
is enabled.  Fixed in version 2.0.

<h3><a name="b657">657.  Russian and Hebrew keyboard modes broken</a></h3>

When SET TERMINAL KBD-FOLLOWS-GL/GR is OFF
Russian and Hebrew keyboard modes don't work.
Off is the default mode.  Turn it ON to work around the bug.  This is
fixed in version 2.0.

<h3><a name="b658">658.  SHOW SSH does not list all forwarded ports</a></h3>

Only the first local and remote forwarded port is listed in the
display.  This is fixed in version 2.0.

<h3><a name="b659">659.  COMPOSE and UCS2 Kverbs in Command Window do not display an input box</a></h3>

The functionality works there is simply no visible feedback on the
status line.  Fixed in version 2.0.

<h3><a name="b660">660.  SET SSH STRICT-HOST-CHECK ASK is treated as OFF</a></h3>

Internally ASK is set to the wrong numeric value and due to the 
order of value testing invalid values are treated as OFF.  This means
that invalid host keys will be accepted without warning.  This is a
security hole in K95.  Fixed in version 2.0.  To work around,
use ON rather than ASK.

<h3><a name="b661">661.  \Kpaste on serial connections only sends 5 or fewer characters</a></h3>

This is a bug introduced in 1.1.21 with no work-around.  Fixed in version 2.0.

<h3><a name="b662">662.  SET TERMINAL KEY { RUSSIAN, HEBREW } does not work</a></h3>

SHOW KEY ... { RUSSIAN, HEBREW } report success but the wrong mapping 
table was being referenced.  There is no work around.  Fixed in version 2.0.

<h3><a name="b663">663.  Spurious K95G screen clearing on startup</a></h3>

If you launch a K95G connection from the Dialer, and the Dialer entry changes
the terminal dimensions, and then if you move the K95G window (and only the
first time you move it), the Terminal screen is cleared (but not lost; the
cleared material is still available in the scrollback buffer).  Should be
fixed in K95 2.1.3.


<h3><a name="b664">664.  Everson Mono Terminal Font Side Effects</a></h3>

It is conceivable that the presence of Everson Mono Terminal on your PC might
affect other applications, such as Netscape, that search for appropriate fonts
to display text in various scripts.  In such cases, if the result is
undesirable, you might need to reconfigure the affected applications, or
uninstall Everson Mono Terminal (in the Windows Control-Panel Fonts dialog).

<h3><a name="b665">665.  Dimensions popup inactive during resize</a></h3>

(Not a bug) If you disable screen updates while moving windows (e.g. in
Windows XP <i>Desktop &rarr; Properties &rarr; Appearrance &rarr; Show window
contents while dragging</i>), then in K95G when <i>Actions &rarr; Resize Mode
&rarr; Changes Dimensions</i> is selected the popup that shows the changing
dimensions is not updated, and with <i>Actions &rarr; Resize Mode &rarr;
Scales Font</i>, you can't watch the font change size.

<h3><a name="b666">666.  Possible Help&rarr;Manual misbehavior</a></h3>

K95G and the Dialer have Help&rarr;Manual dialogs, which bring up the Kermit
95 manual in your Web browser.  This works fine for most users, but several
users have reported various failures or problems with interaction between K95
or the Dialer and browser; these have to do with the particular browser and
version, the particular OS and version, and K95's SET BROWSER value, if any.
K95G and the Dialer are using totally standard APIs for invoking the browser.
In a pinch you can refer to the manual directly using something like:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
file:///C:/Program%20Files/Kermit%2095%202.0/docs/manual/kermit95.htm
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="b667">667.  Underline and Blink control</a></h3>

In K95 2.0, SET TERMINAL ATTRIBUTES UNDERLINE OFF does not disable underlining;
SET TERMINAL ATTTRIBUTE BLINKING OFF does not disable blinking.  Fixed in
2.0.1.  In K95 2.1.3 you can also create a nonblinking cursor with
SET TERMINAL CURSOR <i>{</i>&nbsp;FULL, HALF, UNDERLINE&nbsp;<i>}</i>
NOBLINK.

<h3><a name="b668">668.  Host-Initiated Resize vs Font Scaling</a></h3>

In K95G 2.0, when the Window is maximized and the Resize Mode is "Scales
Font", if the host changes the line width, the font did not resize properly.
Fixed in 2.1.3.

<h3><a name="b669">669.  SET GUI WINDOW RESIZE-MODE command missing</a></h3>

There was no SET GUI WINDOW RESIZE-MODE command in K95G 2.0 to match the
Actions&rarr;Resize Mode menu item.  Fixed in 2.0.1.

<h3><a name="b670">670.  Trouble with COM ports</a></h3>

COM-port connections (but not TAPI ones) could become disconnected upon
escaping back to the Command screen and then re-entering the terminal screen.
Fixed in 2.0.1.

<h3><a name="b671">671.  Toolbar always visible</a></h3>

K95G 2.0 has no method of disabling the functionality of the Tool bar or Menu
bar.  Version 2.1 has a new command SET GUI TOOLBAR OFF, which disables parts
of the toolbar (but does not make it invisible).  Similarly for MENUBAR.
Version 2.1.3 adds command-line options to remove the Menu and Tool bars.

<h3><a name="b672">672.  Upgrade Registration Problem</a></h3>

Copying the registration info from your old K95 version to 2.0 could fail
if your old registration did not include a company name.  Fixed in 2.0.1.

<h3><a name="b673">673.  SRP authentication attempted when not configured on incoming connections</a></h3>

This is a bug that affects 1.1.21 through 2.0.1.  It is fixed in 2.1.
The way to avoid it is to specify a SET TELNET AUTH TYPE
command that does not include SRP.  This command would be placed in 
either the IKSD.KSC (for Internet Kermit Service) or K95CUSTOM.INI
or K95SITE.INI depending on how K95 is being used to accept incoming
connections.

<h3><a name="b674">674.  Extended argument error</a></h3>

When starting K95G from a Dialer entry that was cloned from a template, K95G
can fail, reporting an "Extended argument error".  Diagnosis: Templates have
Lucida Console hard-coded as the default font, but Lucida Console is not
necessarily installed on every Windows computer.  To compound the problem,
K95G fails to start if given an invalid font in the <tt>--facename:</tt>
command-line option.  Fixed in 2.1.  Workaround: Install Lucida
Console; you can download it from
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/truetype/fontpack/"><tt>http://www.microsoft.com/truetype/fontpack/</tt></a>.
And/or change the font on the GUI page of the template (and any entries cloned
from it) to be a monospace font that you have, such as Courier New.

<h3><a name="b675">675.  Non-English Directory Names</a></h3>

Windows directories such as <tt>C:\Documents and
Settings\xxx\Application&nbsp;Data\</tt>
can have different names in different countries, e.g. in Germany:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\xxx\Anwendungsdaten\Kermit 95\</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
For the most part, K95 handles these correctly, but different behavior
(or misbehavior) can occur on different Windows versions; for example,
the Dialer, on first use, might create:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\xxx\Application Data\Kermit 95\</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
which confuses the definition of Kermit variables such as <tt>\v(appdata)</tt>
and <tt>\v(common)</tt>, which in turn can interfere with proper location of
K95's initialization and customization files.  Windows 2000 and XP should be
OK; Windows 9x/ME with IE 5.01 or later should be OK; others might have this
problem, which we will attempt to address in a future release.

<h3><a name="b676">676.  SSH-AGENT.EXE Broken</a></h3>

Apparently this was never tested and nobody noticed until after K95 2.0
was released.  The problems also involve K95's interface to SSH-AGENT.
Fixed in version 2.1.

<h3><a name="b677">677.  Default RGB color values in Dialer off by one</a></h3>

In K95G 2.0, the default RGB values on the Dialer's GUI page should use 128
instead of 127 as the binary value.  Fixed in version 2.1.

<h3><a name="b678">678.  Bulk License update loses number of seats</a></h3>

After applying the K95 2.0 upgrade installation to a Bulk Right-to-Copy
license, the number of seats displayed in the registration screen goes from
whatever it was (e.g. 100) to 1.  This was a bug in the original upgrade
installer.  It is fixed as of 12 June 2002 16:30:00 Eastern USA time.  If your
upgrade was affected by this bug: first make sure your old K95 version is
still on the disk (reinstall from CD if necessary), then use Add/Remove
Programs to remove "Kermit 95 2.0", then download a new copy of the upgrade
from
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95upgrade.html"><tt>http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95upgrade.html</tt></a> and apply it.

<h3><a name="b679">679.  SSH connections to Cisco PIX</a></h3>

If you get "connection refused", it probably means you are attempting a
connection to a server that does not support compression, yet Kermit is
configured to require compression.  Try SET SSH COMPRESSION OFF or,
equivalently, uncheck Data Compression on the Dialer entry's SSH
Settings page.

<h3><a name="b680">680.  TLS CBC Cipher incompatibility with IBM Info Exchange</a></h3>

Between the release of Kermit 95 1.1.21 and Kermit 95 2.0 a vulnerability was
discovered in the SSL/TLS Cipher Suite being used by IBM.  IBM is using 56-bit
DES in Cipher Block Check mode.  This cipher is weak and because of a recent
discovery the CBC mode has been shown to data leakage.  The contents of the
data stream can be read by a passive attacker.  This vulnerability can be
avoided if the SSL/TLS implementation forces the transmission of an empty
SSL/TLS frame (one that contains no application data.)

Kermit 95 uses the OpenSSL open source library as our implementation
of SSL/TLS.  Between 1.1.21 and 2.0 newer releases of OpenSSL became
available.  The fix to avoid the vulnerability was incorporated into
Kermit 95 2.0 when we updated to the newer OpenSSL library.

As it turns out, the IBM server violates the SSL/TLS protocol
specification by failing to properly handle empty frames. 
A workaround is to use a non-CBC mode cipher until IBM is able to
update their server:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>SET AUTH TLS CIPHER-LIST EXP1024-RC4-SHA</tt>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="b681">681. SET TRANSFER MODE MANUAL doesn't completely work</a></h3>

To force a particular file-transfer mode (text or binary) globally for
all transfers, you are supposed to use SET TRANSFER MODE MANUAL to
disable automatic per-file text/binary mode switching and then choose the
disired mode with SET FILE TYPE (Kermit) or SET FTP TYPE (FTP).  This is
not quite sufficient, however.  To finish the job, also SET FILE SCAN OFF.
The bug is that SET TRANSFER MODE MANUAL is supposed to imply SET FILE
SCAN OFF.  Fixed in version 2.1.

<h3><a name="b682">682. COPY command destination file can have junk at end</a></h3>

If the destination of a COPY command is an existing file and the source
file is shorter than the destination file, the source file overlays the
destination file without truncating the excess.  Fixed in version 2.1.
Workaround: delete the destination file first.

<h3><a name="b683">683. Secure FTP authorization failure error message missing</a></h3>

FTP authorization failures were not being reported to the user (even though
the FTP OPEN command failed properly).  Fixed in version 2.1.
Workaround: SET FTP DEBUG ON to see the protocol-level messages.

<h3><a name="b684">684. Fencepost error in FTP MGET /UPDATE</a></h3>

In FTP MGET /UPDATE, equal times spuriously caused download.  Fixed in
version 2.1.

<h3><a name="b685">685. In FTP MGET /RECOVER failures</a></h3>

In FTP MGET /RECOVER, recovery was skipped if the local file is newer than
the remote.  This would seem to make sense, but when a download is
interrupted, the partial file never gets the date of the remote file, so
the partial file is always newer, and recovery never works.  Fixed in the
version 2.1 by ignoring file dates in recovery operations, and also by
setting the file date for a partially received file.

<h3><a name="b686">686. Redundant downloads in FTP MGET /RECOVER wildcard wildcard...</a></h3>

The first file in each wildcard group would always be downloaded.  Fixed
in version 2.1.

<h3><a name="b687">687. Missing message for FTP MGET /EXCEPT</a></h3>

When TRANSFER DISPLAY is set to BRIEF, files skipped due to exception-list
pattern match are reported as "ERROR" with no reason.  The operation works,
but the message is misleading.  Fixed in version 2.1.

<h3><a name="b688">688. Automatic Locus switching fails when FTP connection drops</a></h3>

If an FTP transfer was in progress with automatic locus switching enabled
but the FTP connection drops, the locus does not change back; thus (for
example) a subsequent DELETE command makes Kermit send a REMOTE DELETE
packet on stdout rather than delete a local file.  Fixed in version 2.1.

<h3><a name="b689">689. FILE INCOMPLETE setting ignored by FTP module</a></h3>

The FTP module never handled SET FILE INCOMPLETE.  Fixed in 2.1.

<h3><a name="b690">690. FTP MGET sends superfluous commands to server</a></h3>

When an FTP MGET command has selection clauses that would exclude a file
based on its name (e.g. /COLLISION:DISCARD, /EXCEPT:pattern), it sent
SIZE and/or MDTIM commands to the server for files that would have been
skipped even without this information, which could slow a multifile download
unnecessarily.  Fixed in 2.1.

<h3><a name="b691">691. FTP MGET pattern1 pattern2 pattern3 could stop prematurely</a></h3>

If a list of patterns is given to FTP MGET and any of the patterns matched
no files, the download would stop at that point, rather than proceeding to
the next pattern.  Fixed in 2.1.

<h3><a name="b692">692. Interrupting FTP operations with Ctrl-C is problematic</a></h3>

To be addressed in a future release.

<h3><a name="b693">693. Terminal screen might have fewer columns than desired</a></h3>

If you choose a font and size that would make the Kermit window wider than the
screen at the chosen number of columns, Kermit creates the window with the
maximum number of columns that fit across the screen; for example, 78 instead
of 80.  Workaround: choose a smaller font size.  This should be much improved
in version 2.1, and totally fixed in 2.1.3.

<h3><a name="b694">694.  /POPUP switches in GUI version work improperly</a></h3>

When a /POPUP switch is used in the GUI with commands such as ASK the
generated popup is missing the frame and is displayed with a random color
instead of the HELP color.  Workaround: Use SET GUI DIALOGS OFF or use the
/GUI switch instead of /POPUP.  Fixed in version 2.1.

<h3><a name="b695">695. Changing GUI Resize-Mode behavior while maximized</a></h3>

If the resize-mode is altered while the window is maximized, the condition of
the window when restored is undesireable.  Improved in version 2.1.3.

<h3><a name="b696">696. SET COMMAND CURSOR-POSITION broken</a></h3>

The SET COMMAND CURSOR-POSITION command does not work.  Fixed in 2.1.

<h3><a name="b697">697. SSH disables password based logins upon key change detection</a></h3>

When an SSH Key Change is detected, the password based logins are
disabled in order to prevent theft of user passwords.  However, this
state is not restored for subsequent connection attempts and password
based logins cannot be performed until K95 is restarted.  This is
fixed in 2.1.

<h3><a name="b698">698. Scroll-mode exiting not always possible using the GUI scrollbar</a></h3>

This is fixed in version 2.1.

<h3><a name="b699">699. FTP PUT Text Xfers with Character-set Translation Broken</a></h3>

Character-set translation during FTP PUT operations is broken in version 2.0,
with no workaround.  TEXT transfers without character set translation work
fine.  This is fixed in version 2.1.

<h3><a name="b700">700. SET TERMINAL IDLE-TIMEOUT does not stick in some circumstances</a></h3>

The TELNET, SSH, and SET HOST /CONNECT operations when executed after a SET
TERMINAL IDLE-TIMEOUT command will configure kermit in a manner such that
after exiting CONNECT mode, the IDLE-TIMEOUT value would be reset.  This does
not happen if SET HOST ... is followed by CONNECT instead of using one of the
combined commands.  This is fixed in version 2.1.

<h3><a name="b701">701. Unable to write to various Windows directories from K95</a></h3>

This is not a bug.  K95 checks the READ-ONLY attribute of Directory
entries.  If a directory is marked read-only, it will not be writable.
The default attribute values for each user's:
<p>
<blockquote>
Application Data<br>
Favorites<br>
My Documents<br>
Recent<br>
SentTo<br>
Start Menu
</blockquote>
<p>
directories have the "Read-only" attribute set.  This is set by the 
Windows Shell to indicate that these directories are "special".
K95 2.1 has been modified to ignore the read-only flag when set on
directories.

<h3><a name="b702">702.
Everson Mono Terminal font misbehavior on Win9x/ME
</a></h3>

In earlier versions of Windows, the Everson Mono Terminal font might
look like chicken scratches and sometimes shows a strange horizontal
compression, to the extent that a regular 80-column x 24-row terminal
screen is taller than it is wide.  It behaves (and looks) much better on
Windows 2000 and XP (it can also be used successfully on earlier Windows
versions that have such enhancements as Font Smoothing or Clear Type
installed).  Even then, however, it has some drawbacks: the vertical
spacing is greater than most other monospace fonts, allowing fewer lines
per screen at a given size; the rendering is a bit light; and line- and
box-drawing characters tend not to line up right.  It looks better in
certain color combinations, such as black on white.  We hope that this font
will improve over time.  Despite its drawbacks, we include it with K95 to
allow access to scripts and languages you would not otherwise be able to
see in a terminal session: Georgian, Armenian, Katakana, Cherokee, Coptic,
Runes, Ogham, etc, because these characters are not included in widely
available monospace fonts like Courier New and Lucida Console.  If you
don't need these characters, you might prefer to use a different font.
Beginning in K95 2.1, the default Installer behavior is not to install it.

<h3><a name="b703">703.
FTP MGET Might Fail Immediately with Invalid Temp-File Name
</a></h3>

This bug was new to K95 2.1.0.  Temporary filenames for FTP were being
constructed within a buffer that could be too small.  Fixed in 2.1.1.

<h3><a name="b704">704.
FTP MGET fails when directory segments contain wildcards
</a></h3>

For example, "<tt>ftp</tt> <tt>mget</tt>
<tt>*/data/*.dat</tt>".  New to 2.1.0; fixed in 2.1.1.

<h3><a name="b705">705.
Kerberos Leash Shows Garbage for Local Domain
</a></h3>

Leash32 Options -> Kerberos Properties -> Your Computer's Domain
shows random garbage; this is a known bug in MIT Leash32 2.2.0.
Fixed the version of Leash that is included with K95 2.1.2.

<h3><a name="b706">706.
K95 can't download files named CON or CON.anything
</a></h3>

This is a DOS and Windows feature.  The same is true for any file whose
name (the part before the dot, if any) corresponds to a DOS device name
like CON, LPT, PRN, or COM1.  It's not a Kermit problem.  You can't create
a file on disk with such a name using any other Windows application either.

<h3><a name="b707">707.
TELNET Com Port Control vs the INPUT command
</a></h3>

Numerous problem with the TELNET CPC option and the INPUT command have been
resolved in K95 2.1.2.  The INPUT command would improperly close the network
connection to the host if the Carrier Detect (CD) signal was not raised; even
if Kermit's CARRIER WATCH setting was OFF.  The network connection should not
be closed simply because there is no carrier signal.

<h3><a name="b708">708. VTNT connections vs Ctrl-C</a></h3>

Reportedly the VTNT server absorbs Ctrl-C characters.  Kermit 95 sends them,
but they have no effect at the remote session.  If the report is true, this
would be a problem with the remote server, not with Kermit 95.

<h3><a name="b709">709. Mouse print selection broken in GUI</a></h3>

Button 1 Ctrl-Shift-Drag (default assignment) is supposed to select screen
text and send it to the printer.  This doesn't work in K95 2.1; it either
prints the whole screen or nothing at all.  Diagnosis: a race condition
between threads; The thread that is being spun off to perform the print job is
not starting before mark mode is terminated.  Workaround: Select/Copy the
text, then paste into WordPad or something, then print it.  An all-in-K95
workaround would be define a macro that writes the contents of the \v(select)
variable to a file, then prints the file, then deletes the file.  The macro
could be assigned to a mouse event of your choice.  with the SET MOUSE
command.  Fixed in 2.1.3.

<h3><a name="b710">710. K95 Does Not Support Remote SSH Agent Proxies</a></h3>

This feature was added in K95 2.1.3.

<h3><a name="b711">711. Maximize and Restore versus Resize Mode</a></h3>

(Not a bug) In the GUI version of K95, when the Resize Mode is Change
Dimensions and you maximize the window and then restore it, you get a blank
screen.  Whenever a window's height is reduced, the entire contents of the
window are placed into the scrollback buffer to ensure that the data will not
be overwritten or become garbage.  This behavior has never changed, but might
be more obvious now that the Maximize and Restore controls work.

<!-- The following integrated form newbugs.txt in 2024 -->

<h3><a name="b712">712. FTP Brief-format transaction log shows wrong status</a></h3>

If a transfer failed, the log entry said OK; if the transfer succeeded the
entry said FAILED.  Fixed in 2.1.3.

<h3><a name="b713">713. FTP connections always complain about 'FEAT' command</a></h3>

Kermit sends a FEAT command to see what features the server supports.
However, the FEAT command itself is a relatively new addition to FTP protocol,
so most servers don't understand it and and reply with an error message such
as "'FEAT': Command not understood", which Kermit displays.  K95 2.1.3
suppresses this error message unless FTP DEBUG is ON.

<h3><a name="b714">714. Problems with FTP [M]GET /RECURSIVE</a></h3>

FTP GET /RECURSIVE somepath/somefile didn't work and
MGET /RECURSIVE */somedir/* downloaded the files into the current directory,
rather than re-creating the remote directory structure.  Fixed in K95 2.1.3.

<h3><a name="b715">715. FTP USER and similar commands don't strip quotes</a></h3>

In most contexts there is no way to specify an FTP username that contains one
or more spaces.  Normally this would be done by enclosing the name in
doublequotes or braces, but the parsing code in this did not strip the
enclosing quotes or braces before sending the username to the server.  Ditto
for password and account.  To be fixed in version 3.0.  Workaround:
assign the multiword values to variables and use the variables.  Example:

<pre>
assign \%u Fred Foo
assign \%p Secret Password
ftp user \%u \%p
</pre>

<h3><a name="b716">716. FTP MPUT requires all filespecs to match at least one file</a></h3>

The command "ftp mput *.jpg *.gif *.bmp" gets a parse error and does not
execute if any of the file specifications do not match any files.  This is
fine for interactive sessions, but not good for scripts.  For scripts
use something like:

<pre>
ftp mput *.jpg
ftp mput *.gif
ftp mput *.tif
</pre>

or:

<pre>ftp mput *.{jpg,gif,tif}</pre>

or:

<pre>ftp mput "{*.jpg,*.gif,*.tif}"</pre>

Type HELP WILDCARDS for more information about the syntax.  Fixed in 2.1.3,
which allows FTP MPUT commands to contain filenames or patterns that do not
match any files, and the command will simply skip over them and still transfer
any files that do match, and will fail only if no files match at all, or if
any of the transfers fail.

<h3><a name="b717">717. GREP (FIND) does not allow pattern variables</a></h3>

The GREP (FIND, SEARCH) command does not expand pattern variables; it takes
the pattern literally.  To be fixed in the next release.  Workaround:

<pre>
define mygrep {
local xx
assign xx {
find \%1 \%2
if fail end 1
}
do xx
if fail end 1
}
</pre>

and then use MGREP instead of GREP.

<h3><a name="b718">718. Dialer GUI Menu/Tool/Status Bar settings don't stick</a></h3>
Any changes to the Menu Bar, Tool Bar, or Status Bar check boxes
in the Dialer's GUI Settings page are not saved when you exit from the
Dialer.

<p>Workaround: After checking or unchecking the GUI-page boxes as desired,
click OK on the GUI page, then click Shortcut on the Dialer's Toolbar, then
launch the connection from the shortcut rather than from the Dialer entry.

<p>This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b719">719. The K95 command parser does not handle the NUL device</a></h3>

Using NUL (or NUL: or NUL.anything) in a Kermit command in place of a
filename does not always have the expected effect.  Instead, the command tends
to fail with "?file not found".

This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b720">720. INPUT n \fpattern(xxx) doesn't work for case-independent matches</a></h3>

Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b721">721. MINPUT n ... \fpattern(xxx) ... doesn't work at all.</a></h3>

The MINPUT command does not handle patterns.  Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b722">722. Associative array references not case sensitive</a></h3>

Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b723">723. SET KEY xxx \27H erroneously lowercases the value</a></h3>

Any SET KEY command in which the first character of the definition was
backslash quantity, and the ONLY character after the backslash quantity
was an uppercase letter, e.g. "set key \1234 \27H", would erroneously
lowercase the letter.  Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b724">724. Failing FTP CD/CDUP/RMDIR does not set failure status</a></h3>

FTP CD, FTP CDUP, and FTP RMDIR did not set the failure status when they
failed, thus IF FAILURE or IF SUCCESS tests after these commands did not
work when they failed.  Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b725">725. The RENAME command sometimes fails without printing an error message</a></h3>

Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b726">726. ENABLE/DISABLE QUERY broken</a></h3>

ENABLE QUERY or DISABLE QUERY always give a parse error.  Fixed in 3.0.

<h3><a name="b727">727. CD command with wildcard broken</a></h3>

For example, "cd a*" when only directory name begins with "a".
Fixed in 3.0.

<h3><a name="b728">728. DIRECTORY command with multiple filespecs can list too many files</a></h3>

Example: "directory a b c" lists all files whose names END WITH a, b,
or c, rather than the files whose names ARE a, b, or c.  Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b729">729. Display of Plane-1-and-beyond Unicode characters</a></h3>

At present, Kermit 95 can not display Unicode characters beyond Plane
0, i.e. whose code values have more than 16 significant bits.
Examples include Gothic, Old Italic, and Vietnamese Nom.  This
limitation is due to the lack of support in the Windows operating
system for glyphs beyond Plane 0.

<h3><a name="b730">730. k95g.exe ssh://xyzcorp.com --nobars causes invalid memory reference</a></h3>

Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b731">731. Long Read Delays when using USB Serial Ports or Modems</a></h3>

K95's device ReadIntervalTimeout parameter is set to MAXDWORD, the
intention being for the read to return immediately after the first
byte(s) arrive.  But serial port drivers differ in their
interpretation of the serial port character-read timeout parameters.
When a serial port or modem uses the USB bus rather than the PCI bus,
this can result in a 500 second delay between reads unless the buffer
is filled.  This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b732">732. Backspace Key setting in Dialer -> Keyboard might be ignored</a></h3>

If you have a SET KEY \127 xxx command in your K95.INI, K95SITE.INI,
or K95CUSTOM.INI file, this overrides the Backspace Key setting in the
Dialer's Keyboard Settings page, even though the Dialer script is
executed AFTER the INI file.  <!--Fixed in the next release.-->

<!-- The K95 side of the fix is perhaps the "set dialer backspace" command,
     not sure if our version of the dialer currently uses it though -->

<h3><a name="b733">733. SET PRINTER command in Dialer-generated scripts</a></h3>

One user reported that it takes a long time to make a connection from
the Dialer, and traced the problem to the SET PRINTER command that is
included in every Dialer connection script.  The SET PRINTER command
queries Windows for a list of printers, and in this case, the query
was taking a very long time.  The user deleted the default printer and
recreated it, and the problem went away.

<h3><a name="b734">734. Sessions Logs are always 8-bit</a></h3>

Session logs always record the 8th bit of each character, even when
PARITY is not NONE, and/or even when TERMINAL BYTESIZE is 7.  In these
cases the 8th bit should be stripped (unless SET SESSION-LOG DEBUG is
in effect).  To be fixed in a future release.  In the meantime you can
use:

<pre>
SET TERMINAL BYTESIZE 7
SET PRINTER /FILE:name-for-log-file
SET TERMINAL PRINT AUTO
</pre>

to create a 7-bit session log.

<h3><a name="b735">735. Macros on Keys broken</a></h3>

In versions 1.1.21 through 2.1.3, when a SET [TERMINAL] KEY definition
includes a macro invocation, then pressing the key while in the
Terminal screen returns to the command screen (and in some cases might
also fail to execute the macro).  A workaround would be to:

<pre>
define myconnect connect /synchronous
; (make the connection with SET PORT, DIAL, or SET HOST)
if success do myconnect
</pre>

This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b736">736. FTP MGET might not fail when it should</a></h3>

When SET FTP ERROR-ACTION is QUIT and a file in an MGET sequence
fails, Kermit just goes on to the next file, rather than quitting and
failing.  This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b737">737. No way to totally disable WIKSD event logging</a></h3>

One message written to the event log prior to the processing of the
IKSD.KSC file; thus even if IKSD.KSD says "no logging", log records
will accumulate.  It is unclear at the current time when this will
occur.  There is also known to be a handle leak in IKSDSVC.EXE which
can result in system instability.  This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b738">738. OpenSSL Security holes in 0.9.7</a></h3>

Version 2.1.2 of Kermit 95 ships with OpenSSL 0.9.7 which contains
known security holes.  These holes have been fixed in subsequent
releases.  The current release at the time of 2.1.2 was 0.9.7f.
Fixed in Kermit 95 3.0.

<h3><a name="b739">739. Kerberos for Windows updates</a></h3>

Version 2.1.2 of Kermit 95 ships with an outdated version of MIT
Kerberos for Windows which does not support AES encryption and
contains interoperability problems with the Microsoft Windows Active
Directory implementation of Kerberos and MIT Kerberos 5 Release 1.3.x.
Version 3.0 upgrades to the latest version of MIT Kerberos for Windows
which should resolve these issues

<p>Kermit itself has been improved to support new Microsoft Kerberos
functionality including new encryption types as well as use of the
Kerberos tickets stored in the Microsoft Logon Session Kerberos cache.

<h3><a name="b740">740. OpenSSH Security holes</a></h3>

Version 2.1.2 of Kermit 95 ships with OpenSSH 3.5 support containing
known security holes.  The OpenSSH support in the next release of Kermit
95 2.x will be updated to OpenSSH 3.6.1 with extensions for SRP and GSSAPI
Kerberos.

<p>Kermit 95 Version 3.0 includes an entirely new SSH implementation which
resolves all past security issues. SRP security is no longer supported.

<h3><a name="b741">741. SEND command in Kermit function causes crash</a></h3>

A SEND command embedded in a macro and executed as a function with
\Fexecute(macro) would cause K95 to crash.  This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b742">742. Denial of Service attack against TCP/IP SET HOST * connections</a></h3>

Incoming TCP/IP connections did not provide for timeouts enabling a
remote attacker to perform a denial of service attack against K95
configured to accept incoming connections.  This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b743">743. SSL/TLS Private Key Passphrase Dialog reveals passphrase</a></h3>

The passphrase dialog for private keys accessed during SSL/TLS
connection attempts does not obscure the passphrase input.  This is
fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b744">744. Pragma Systems Terminal Server Not Supported</a></h3>

Kermit 95 has supported being used as a Kermit protocol engine under
the Pragma Systems Telnet and SSH daemons but not the Terminal Server
product.  This is fixed in 3.0.

<h3><a name="b745">745. Communication devices passed to Kermit as handles are closed on exit</a></h3>

Starting in 3.0, if a communication device is passed to
Kermit 95 for use via an already existing HANDLE, the default for the
SET EXIT HANGUP command will be OFF.

<h3><a name="b746">746. SET TCP HTTP-PROXY cannot be used with HTTP connections</a></h3>

Support for using HTTP Proxy connections for HTTP connections has
been added to version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b747">747. UNC paths do not work during FTP operations</a></h3>

Support for using UNC paths with FTP operations has been added to version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b748">748. Dialer QUICK Command improvements</a></h3>

<!-- The dialer QUICK command did not allow connections to be based on
existing template and could not be saved for later use.  The next
release supports the use of templates in the QUICK command and allows
the command to be used as a poor man's CLONE.-->

The dialer QUICK command does not allow connections to be based on an
existing template and can not be saved for later use. An enhancement
to resolve this was originally developed as part of the Kermit 95 v2.2
work, but those changes have been lost and there are <em>at this time</em> no
plans to redevelop that feature from scratch. Instead due to the
aging framework and compilers the Dialer depends on, the Windows version
of the Dialer will eventually be replaced by an entirely new and more
fit-for-purpose application (see Github issue
    <a href="https://github.com/davidrg/ckwin/issues/317">#317</a> for
    more information).

<p>This is also logged as
    <a href="https://github.com/davidrg/ckwin/issues/267">Issue #267 on Github</a></p>

<h3><a name="b749">749. Linux Character Set handling bugs</a></h3>

There are bugs in the handling of the Linux Character Set.  These have
been fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b750">750. XMODEM-CRC checksums are not computed properly</a></h3>

The XMODEM-CRC checksum computations <!--were-->are not performed properly in
all instances.  <!--This has been fixed in the next release.-->

<h3><a name="b751">751. BEEP when setting window title in a terminal session</a></h3>

An inadvertant beep was produced when a SET TITLE control sequence was
received from the host.  This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b752">752. NEW FEATURE: SSH Debug Logging</a></h3>

Version 3.0 supports the ability to log debugging messages to the
debug.log file to assist in diagnosing connection problems.

<h3><a name="b753">753. Telnet AUTH vs Telnet START_TLS protocol negotiation conflicts</a></h3>

A protocol message sequencing error could occur when connecting to
some hosts which support both the AUTH and START_TLS Telnet protocol
options.  This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b754">754. NEW FEATURE: SSH Version 2 Protocol Automatic Rekeying</a></h3>

SET SSH V2 AUTO-REKEY {ON, OFF} has been added to version 3.0 to
support automatic rekeying of long lasting ssh version 2 connections.

<h3><a name="b755">755. Extended command line options not properly processed</a></h3>

When using a mixture of Extended command line options the even
numbered options would be misinterpretted as multi-valued switches.
This would produce very odd and unexpected results.  This is fixed in
version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b756">756. SSH URLs did not set the window title</a></h3>

When starting K95 from a command line with an SSH URL or via a browser
using an SSH URL, the title of the K95 window would not be properly
set to the host name.  This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b757">757. NEW FEATURE: SKERMIT command</a></h3>

The SKERMIT ssh subsystem functionality now has its own shortcut
command.  No longer is it necessary to enter

<pre>
SET NETWORK TYPE SSH
SET HOST host /SUBSYSTEM:SKERMIT
</pre>

instead

<pre>
SKERMIT host
</pre>

is all that is required.  This is available in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b758">758. Process handle leak in the IKSD Service</a></h3>

A process handle leak in the IKSD Service could cause Windows to be
unable to start subsequent processes and/or become very sluggish.
This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b759">759. NEW FEATURE: FTP SSLv2 connections</a></h3>

K95 follows the specification for FTP AUTH SSL and FTP AUTH TLS and
does not support the antiquated SSLv2 protocol on FTP connections.
Unfortunately, not everyone else follows the specification.  A new command

<pre>
SET FTP BUG USE_SSL_V2 {ON, OFF}
</pre>

has been added to allow SSLv2 to be used with servers that won't
negotiate SSLv3 or TLSv1.  This is available in version 3.0 only when
compiled against OpenSSL 1.0.2 as newer versions of OpenSSL exclude SSLv2
support.

<h3><a name="b760">760. </a></h3>

A new command

<pre>
SET SSH HEARTBEAT-INTERVAL &lt;seconds&gt;
</pre>

has been added to the next release to allow the SSH to be maintained
during long idle periods.  This is similar to the

<pre>
SET TERMINAL IDLE-ACTION TELNET-NOP
SET TERMINAL IDLE-TIMEOUT &lt;seconds&gt;
</pre>

which can be used to preserve TELNET connections without actually
sending data to the host applications.

<h3><a name="b761">761. NEW FEATURE: ON_CD macro</a></h3>

A new auto-execute macro, ON_CD, can be defined in version 3.0.
This macro is executed whenever a change directory operation occurs
either due to a CD command or a Kermit protocol operation.

<h3><a name="b762">762. NEW FEATURE: FTP MLSD parsing of extended strings</a></h3>
<h3><a name="b763">763. SET ATTRIBUTES DATE OFF did not apply to XYZmodem file transfers</a></h3>

<!--In the next release the SET ATTRIBUTES DATE OFF command can be used to
ignore the actual date information of the file and instead use the
current date/time information as the file is sent or received.-->

The SET ATTRIBUTES DATE OFF command should be able to be used to ignore
the actual date information of the file and instead use the current date/time
information as the file is sent or received

<h3><a name="b764">764. FTP ASCII transfers generated incorrect end of line when sending</a></h3>

FTP SEND file transfers of ASCII files to Unix or MacOSX hosts produce
the wrong end of line marker.  This has been fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b765">765. </a></h3>

Firewalls often filter HTTP requests based upon the Agent tag in the
HTTP headers.  The Agent tag is supposed to indicate the requesting
application.  To allow Kermit to pretend to be Netscape, Mozilla or
Internet Explorer a new

<pre>
SET TCP HTTP-PROXY /AGENT:&lt;agent-string&gt;
</pre>

option has been added.  This is available in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b766">766. Windows Registry entries containing environment variables are not processed correctly</a></h3>

Windows Registry entries containing environment variables should have
the environment variables expanded before use.  This is important for
roaming profiles and the locations of network available applications.
<!--The next release of Kermit 95 will properly expand this registry
strings.-->

<h3><a name="b767">767. Reverse DNS Lookups cannot always be disabled</a></h3>

There are some circumstances in the SET HOST operation in which
reverse dns lookups are not always disabled by SET TCP
REVERSE-DNS-LOOKUP OFF.  This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b768">768. Directory operations fail on network mapped file systems which do not provide date information</a></h3>

Some networked mapped file systems do not provide attribute
information for directory entries.  This causes the Microsoft C
Runtime Library stat() command to fail.  <!--The next version of Kermit 95
replaces all calls to C Runtime Library file routines with new
functionality implemented solely using the Win32 API.-->

<h3><a name="b769">769. IBM 3151 emulation is missing keymap assignments for some keys</a></h3>

The IBM 3151 emulation was missing kverbs for the Home and BackTab
keys.  The I31_F21 kverb would send the output of the F11 key.  These
have been fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b770">770. Dialer FTP entries did not preserve alternative port numbers</a></h3>

When the connection type is FTP, the port number is not entered into
the appropriate field when editing.  This means that editing an
existing entry which requires an alternate port will lose the
alternate port if the GENERAL page is edited and saved.  This is fixed in 3.0.

<h3><a name="b771">771. NEW FEATURE: Hyperlink Extensions for ANSI based terminals</a></h3>

Hyperlink Extension for Terminals based on
ANSI X3.64-1979/ISO-6429/ECMA-048

<p>The hyperlink extension utilizes the Device Control Sequence (DCS) to
implement both URL and UNC hyperlinks within the terminal session with
the equivalent of the HTML HREF tag:

<pre>
&lt;a href="http:/host/path?parameters"&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

In an HREF tag, only the "Click Here" string is visible to the end
user. Clicking on any character in the string will result in the
execution of the URL. The DCS equivalent to the HREF tag is:

<pre>
&lt;DCS&gt; Pn + m &lt;link string&gt; &lt;ST&gt;
</pre>

where:
<ul>
<li>&lt;DCS&gt; is either the 8-bit DCS control or the 7-bit sequence
<li>&lt;ESC&gt; P &lt;ST&gt; is either the 8-bit ST control or the 7-bit sequence
<li>&lt;ESC&gt; \ Pn is one of three parameters: <ul>
    <li>0 - terminate the hyperlink attribute
    <li>1 - activate a URL hyperlink attribute
    <li>2 - activate a UNC hyperlink attribute
    </ul>
<li>&lt;link string&gt; is the link text which may optionally be surrounded
    in double quotes.
</ul>

Here is an example of how this extension is used to specify a URL
hyperlink associated with a text string displayed to the end user:

<pre>
&lt;DCS&gt;1+m"http://www.kermitproject.org"&lt;ST&gt;Kermit Home Page&lt;DCS&gt;0+m&lt;ST&gt;
</pre>

When this string is received by a supporting terminal emulator, at the
present only Kermit 95 3.0.0 or higher, a hyperlink character
attribute is defined. This character attribute behaves identically to
a Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) character attribute such as Bold,
Underline, or Reverse.  Terminal emulators which do not support this
extension would only display the contents of the display string. An
example of a UNC hyperlink follows:

<pre>
&lt;DCS&gt;2+m"\\server\path\document.pdf"&lt;ST&gt;Acrobat Document&lt;DCS&gt;0+m&lt;ST&gt;
</pre>

The hyperlink attribute can be combined with SGR sequences to specify
display attributes for the hyperlink:
<pre>
&lt;DCS&gt;1+m"http://www.cdaero.com"&lt;ST&gt;&lt;CSI&gt;4mCD Aero Home &lt;CSI&gt;24m&lt;DCS&gt;0+m&lt;ST&gt;
</pre>
In the above sequence a URL hyperlink is specified in combination with
the Underline SGR sequence. The display text is therefore displayed
with an underline. When the display text is printed the underline and
URL hyperlink attributes are removed. This behavior could also have
been obtained with the sequence:
<pre>
&lt;DCS&gt;1+m"http://www.cdaero.com"&lt;ST&gt;&lt;CSI&gt;4mCD Aero Home&lt;CSI&gt;0m
</pre>
This is because the SGR 0 sequence means to clear all character
display attributes. Only one hyperlink attribute may be specified at a
time. Therefore, sequences of the following form are also valid:

<pre>
&lt;DCS&gt;1+m"http://www.cdaero.com/index.html"&lt;ST&gt;Web
&lt;DCS&gt;2+m"\\server\public_html\index.html"&lt;ST&gt;UNC&lt;DCS&gt;0+m&lt;ST&gt;
</pre>
In this sequence the URL hyperlink is replaced by a UNC hyperlink and
then hyperlink attributes are disabled. Kermit 95 3.0.0 will display
with an associated hyperlink according to the values specified with
the command:

<pre>
SET TERMINAL URL-HIGHLIGHT ON &lt;attribute list&gt;
</pre>
Where &lt;attribute list&gt; is one or more of: BLINK, BOLD, DIM, INVISIBLE,
ITALIC, NORMAL, REVERSE, and UNDERLINED. The default is BOLD for the
console version and BOLD UNDERLINED for the gui version. This
extension is supported in the following terminal types: AIXTERM,
ANNARBOR, ANSI-BBS, AT386, AVATAR/0+, BETERM, HFT, LINUX, QANSI,
SCOANSI, SNI-97801, SUN, VT220, VT220PC, VT320, VT320PC, WY370.

<h3><a name="b772">772. ANSI DCS sequences containing an intermediary '$' character are improperly handled</a></h3>

<h3><a name="b774">774. UNC paths in file transfer operations generate errors</a></h3>

This bug is fixed by the same code changes as number 768.

<h3><a name="b775">775. SET TITLE &lt;title-string&gt; is not brace stripped</a></h3>

In version 3.0, braces or doublequotes may be safely placed
surrounding the title string.  They will be stripped off before the
window title is applied.

<h3><a name="b776">776. MOVE-TO and RENAME-TO functionality did not work with XYZmodem transfers</a></h3>

The MOVE-TO and RENAME-TO functions were never implemented for
XYZmodem.  <!--This support has been added to the next release for both
SEND and RECEIVE operations.--> Support needs to be added for both SEND
    and RECEIVE operations.


<h3><a name="b777">777. SEND /MOVE-TO:&lt;directory&gt; fails when using Kermit protocol</a></h3>

The SEND /MOVE-TO: switch was broken.  It incorrectly overwrote the file

transfer.  This is fixed in 3.0.

<h3><a name="b778">778. SET TERMINAL DEBUG ON command does not work.</a></h3>

The command does not work but the keyboard verb \KDebug which is mapped to
Alt-D does.  This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b779">779. The INFORMATION sound generates no audible output</a></h3>

The wrong system sound was being called for BEEP INFORMATION or events

<h3><a name="b780">780. NEW FEATURE: DG4xx Set Cursor Type support</a></h3>

The DG4xx Set Cursor Type sequence &lt;RS&gt; F Q &lt;type&gt; is now implemented for
Data General terminals and many other DG4xx sequences are now parsed even
if we do nothing with them.  This prevents unwanted characters from
disrupting the display layout when 400 series commands are sent to 200

<h3><a name="b781">781. SET PRINTER command causes Kermit to crash</a></h3>

A SET PRINTER command on a machine without any Windows Printer queues

<h3><a name="b782">782. ANSI Backtab Control Sequence (CSI Z) does not function</a></h3>

The ANSI control sequence CSI Z is supposed to be equivalent to
CSI 1 Z.  Unfortunately, it is interpreted since 1.1.21 as CSI 0 Z
which results in the Backtab functionality being disabled.  This is
fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b783">783. NEW FEATURE: GUI TYPE command</a></h3>

The SCO sequence   <tt>CSI 2 ; &lt;fg&gt; ; &lt;bg&gt; m</tt> sets the fg and bg
colors to black instead of the specified values.  This is fixed
in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b785">785. SCO Set Function Key sequence if mis-used can corrupt the data stream</a></h3>

The SCO set function key sequence    <tt>ESC Q &lt;fn&gt; &lt;quote&gt; .... &lt;quote&gt;</tt>
breaks the ANSI X3.64 parsing rules.  This can result in data being lost if
the sequence  <tt>ESC Q</tt>   is sent to the terminal without properly specifying
the &lt;fn&gt; and &lt;quote&gt; characters.  As of version 3.0, if &lt;fn&gt; is an
invalid character the specified character will be pushed back onto the data
stream and reparsed in case the ESC Q was mistakenly used.  Under normal
circumstances ESC Q would be treated as the PU1 STRING sequence introducer.

<h3><a name="b786">786. IBM Info Exchange commands fail randomly with SSL_R_MISSING_EXPORT_TMP_RSA_KEY error</a></h3>

This is a bug in the OpenSSL library used to provide SSL/TLS support
in Kermit 95.  While the IBM Info Exchange service no longer exists, the bug
that once affected it should be fixed in version 3.0

<h3><a name="b787">787. Dialer generates incomplete script when Transaction Logging is On</a></h3>

When transaction logging is turned on, the dialer generates an
incomplete SET TRANSACTION-LOG command.  This either results in
a warning or a fatal script execution depending on the state of
SET TAKE ERROR.  <!--This is fixed in the next release.-->


<h3><a name="b788">788. Named Pipe Network Connections are not supported on Windows</a></h3>

In version 3.0, Named Pipe connections (both client and
server side) have been added.  Client side named pipe connections
can be used in conjunction with VMWare and other hypervisors to
allow K95 to be used either as a terminal connected to a serial
tty (redirected to a named pipe) or for use in logging syslog
output on the host system.

<h3><a name="b789">789. FTP FEAT response improperly parsed</a></h3>

The response to the FTP FEAT command is used to determine
which features the FTP server supports.  Kermit improperly
parsed this response resulting in the FTP client functionality
being improperly configured.  This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b790">790. SET FTP CHARACTER-SET-TRANSLATION ON displayed garbage</a></h3>

When SET FTP CHARACTER-SET-TRANSLATION ON is set, Kermit 95
would output FTP server responses to the screen in the wrong
byteorder.  This would result in output appearing to be unreadable.
This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b791">791. Dialer generates incorrect FTP Connection Scripts</a></h3>

The dialer generates FTP connection scripts which use the
FTP OPEN /USER /PASSWORD plus SET FTP AUTOLOGIN ON which is
not a safe script operation since the failure state of the
FTP OPEN command does not indicate whether the login succeeded.
Instead, FTP USER and SET FTP AUTOLOGIN OFF should be used.
In addition, commands entered into the Login Script page textbox
were not included in the generated script.  <!--These errors are
fixed in the next release.-->

<h3><a name="b792">792. Installer does not initialize TAPI</a></h3>

Kermit 95 requires that the Telephony API (TAPI) be configured
for the machine for all users of the machine.  The Telephony
subsystem is configured using the Phone and Modems Options
control panel.  If TAPI has not been configured, TAPI will
attempt to prompt the user for configuration data the first time
the subsystem is activated by an application.  If the user
account under which the application is started does not have the
necessary privileges to make changes to the local machine
configuration (they are not Administrator), the application which
uses TAPI will fail to start properly.  In the case of Kermit 95,
this means that while the Kermit 95 GUI Window (or console
window) may open properly, the application will be unusable for
about two minutes until the TAPI subsystem fails.  The fact that
the TAPI subsystem is left unconfigured after the Kermit 95
installation should be considered a bug in the Kermit 95
installer.  The installer really should query TAPI to force the
configuration of the machine.


<h3><a name="b793">793. Print Selection Doesn't Work</a></h3>

Ctrl-Shift-Drag events are not recognized by K95.  Therefore the
Select-and-Print operation that is assigned by default to Mouse Button 1
Ctrl-Shift-Drag is inoperative.  Fixed in version 3.0.  Workaround:
Drag the mouse over the desired text WITHOUT Shift and Ctrl pressed.  Then,
before releasing the mouse button, press the Ctrl and Shift keys.  Then
release the mouse button, then release the keys.

<h3><a name="b794">794. Dialer Database Corruption</a></h3>

The Dialer database can be damaged in various ways, mostly by bugs in the C++
Class libraries that were used to build the Dialer.  Many of these bugs have
been worked around in version 2.1.3, so if you are running an earlier
version, you should upgrade to 2.1.3:

<pre>http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95upgrade.html</pre>

<p>A significant re-write of the Class Libraries took place after 2.1.3 was
released to make them compatible with the latest Microsoft development
tools.  These changes were to be incorporated into the next K95 release,
but were lost in the intervening years and the dialer that ships with Kermit 95
version 3.0 is based on the K95 2.1.2 dialer. Meanwhile, in 2.1.3 a corrupted entry
in a .DAT file (if it cannot be corrected automatically) will cause the user
to notified of the problem,
specifying the entry that was damaged and indicating that the entry will be
deleted.  Meanwhile, Kermit 95 creates an automatic backup each time the
.DAT file is edited.  The backups are located in the same directory as the
.DAT file, which varies according to your OS version and installation
choices; see the K95 README file for details:

<pre>http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95readme.html</pre>

<p>and have filenames ending in .BK1, .BK2, .BK3, etc.  To restore from a
backup, move or rename your corrupted DIALUSR.DAT for possible future
analysis, and copy the latest backup to DIALUSR.DAT.  If that one is corrupt
too, repeat the process going back through the previous backup copies.

<p>As of Kermit 95 version 3.0, the dialer (based on the code from K95 2.1.2)
is no longer under active development and only receiving occasional bug fixes
where the fix is easy. This is because the Class libraries that were used to
build the Dialer are no longer supported by the original vendor and haven't
received any updates in over 20 years rendering them incompatible with modern
compilers and increasingly out of place on modern Windows.

<p>The long-term focus now is to eventually build a from-scratch replacement
for the dialer that does not suffer from these problems.

<h3><a name="b795">795. Printer output includes question marks instead of non-ASCII characters such as line drawing characters.</a></h3>

There is a bug in the SET PRINTER /CHARACTER-SET: processing which
will always cause the printer character set to be assigned the value
of "Danish ASCII".  This bug will cause all non-ASCII characters to
be printed as question marks.  The only work around is to not issue
a /CHARACTER-SET command which will leave the value at the default
which happens to be Code Page 437.  Unfortunately, the dialer always
issues a /CHARACTER-SET command and there is no work around for that.
This is fixed version 3.0.


<h3><a name="b796">796. Titles set with --title are cleared after a connection is established</a></h3>

The behavior of --title should be the same as "SET TITLE".  The
work around is to use the form -C "set title text".  This is fixed
in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b797">797. Dialer generated scripts include SET LOGIN PROMPT and SET LOGIN PASSWORD commands when fields are empty</a></h3>

Dialer generated connection scripts include SET LOGIN PROMPT and
SET LOGIN PASSWORD commands when the fields are empty.  This can
break the use of the standard login.ksc script.  There is no
work around.  Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b798">798. NEW FEATURE: --noclose command line option</a></h3>

This new feature for the GUI version allows the [x] button and
File-&gt;Exit menu item to be disabled.  This has been added in
version 3.0.


<h3><a name="b799">799. Writing to VTxxx Status Line corrupted when display cursor on right margin</a></h3>

If the VTxxx writable status line is in use, if the display cursor
is located at the right margin, text written to the Status line will
be inappropriately line wrapped.  There is no work around.  This
is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b800">800. In key mappings, the form \K{verb} is ignored</a></h3>

When assigning key mappings, it is often necessary to surround
the verb name in braces to avoid parsing collisions.  For example,

<pre>SET KEY key \40\Kverb\41</pre>

is mapped to the key as

<pre>(\Kverb)</pre>

which will be output to the host as "(" because "verb)" is not a
valid verb name.  There are two work arounds.  You can map the
key definition as either:

<pre>
\\40\Kverb\\41
\40\{Kverb}\41
</pre>

This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b801">801. SET TERMINAL IDLE-ACTION OUTPUT does not send NUL</a></h3>

Bug, fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b802">802. Date-time differencing across years broken.</a></h3>

Bug, fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b803">803. No way to HTTP GET a file that has metacharacters in its name.</a></h3>

Fixed in version 3.0

<h3><a name="b804">804. Some string-matching patterns don't work</a></h3>

Patterns containing * followed by an [abc] or [a-z] selection construction
could fail under some conditions.  Certain other patterns could cause Kermit
to go into an infinite loop.  Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b805">805. IF with disconnected multistatement ELSE part broken</a></h3>

IF-ELSE statements of the form:

<pre>
IF condition {
statement
statement
...
}
ELSE {
statement
statement
...
}
</pre>

do not work.  Workaround: put the ELSE after the closing bracket of the IF
group: "} ELSE {".  Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b806">806. REMOTE DIRECTORY response lines terminated only by LF</a></h3>

These lines should be terminated by CRLF.  Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b807">807. DNS SRV records don't work with SSH</a></h3>

Bug: The SRV lookup only occurs if you explicitly specify a service name.
If you enter your connection as "ssh hostname ssh" it will work.

<h3><a name="b808">808. K95 spuriously seizes focus</a></h3>

If Kermit 95 is started in such a way that its window would be wider or
taller than the physical screen size at the configured resolution, Windows
will pop the K95 window into focus because it "needs attention".  This can
happen if K95 is in the background, or indeed, even when it is in the
foreground but displaying a dialog box (e.g. for the SSH password).  A quick
workaround is to maximize the K95 window, which forces K95 to adjust the
font size to the screen size and resolution.  The real solution is to set
the monitor to a higher resolution (if possible), or else to use a smaller
font size and/or smaller screen dimensions (rows and/or columns).

<h3><a name="b809">809. S-Expression division broken in K95</a></h3>

An S-Expression like (/ a b) causes a fatal error if the magnitude of b
is less than one.  This bug was fixed in C-Kermit shortly after K95 2.1.3
was released.  The fix is in K95 version 3.0.  Workaround:
replace (/ a b) with \ffpdiv(a,b).

<h3><a name="b810">810. GSSAPI authentication doesn't work for SSH</a></h3>

GSSAPI changed after K95 2.1.3 was released; there is presently no way
to authenticate with K95 2.1.3 against modern versions of GSSAPI.
This is fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b811">811. KCD DOWNLOAD command doesn't work in Windows Vista and Windows 7</a></h3>

Apparently the Windows API for finding the user's Download directory
changed since Windows XP.  Workaround: SET FILE DOWNLOAD-DIRECTORY
will populate the \v(download) variable and allow KCD DOWNLOAD to work.

<h3><a name="b812">812. Autodownload GUI Dialog needs more buttons</a></h3>

The default TERMINAL AUTODOWNLOAD setting for K95 is ASK, which causes a
dialog to pop up for each file, giving you the opportunity to say OK or No
to accept or refuse the file.  This is not good when downloading a large
group of files.  There should also be buttons for "Yes to all", "No to all".
There should also be a note in the box to the effect that these dialogs
could be suppressed, if desired, by adding SET TERMINAL AUTODOWNLOAD ON to
K95CUSTOM.INI or in the Actions-&gt;Autodownload menu (change the setting
from Ask to On).

<h3><a name="b813">813. Kermit 95 and large files</a></h3>

Experimentation has shown that, although K95 is not supposed to be capable
of transferring large files (longer than about 2GB), it can indeed send and
receive them successfully.  However the file transfer display is wrong --
the numbers, the progress bar, the percent done, since K95 2.1.3 does not
support long integers (well, it does, but in the Windows C compiler with
which K95 was built, sizeof(long) == sizeof(int) == 4).  Similarly any
post-transfer statistics and transaction logging will also have nonsensical
numbers. This has been fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b814">814. Using K95 as a terminal emulator to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5</a></h3>

K95's default terminal emulation is vt320, which is well understood by
RHEL5.  However, by default (or perhaps always) certain RHEL applications
write to the terminal in Unicode UTF-8, such as gcc 4.1.2, which outputs
filenames in warning messages in "smart quotes" that are encoded in UTF-8.
K95 supports UTF-8, but not as its default terminal character set, so when
the first error or warning message comes out, the screen goes blank, because
the multibyte Unicode character happens to be the same as a VT320 8-bit
escape sequence.  This is not a bug, just a surprise.  Simply choose "utf8"
in the character set box on the toolbar, or "set terminal character-set
utf8".

<h3><a name="b815">815. Incoming Ctrl-Z (SUB) character not properly displayed in VT emulation</a></h3>

The Ctrl-Z character, SUB, ASCII 26 (decimal) is supposed to be displayed
as a reverse question mark in VT320 emulation but it is not displayed at
all.  Reportedly this causes major discomfort when using the VMS TPU editor.
There doesn't seem to be a workaround for this.

<p>Fixed in Kermit 95 3.0 which uses unicode character 0x2426 (Symbol For
    Substitute Form Two) for the reverse question-mark. Many fonts don't include
    this character, but on Windows 10 and up Cascadia Mono (also used by the
    Windows Terminal) does.

<h3><a name="b816">816. 80/132 column switching and Resize Mode</a></h3>

Clarification: At present, the command

<pre>SET GUI WINDOW RESIZE-MODE { SCALE-FONT, CHANGE-DIMENSION }</pre>

applies only when changing the window size by dragging an edge or corner
with the mouse.  It does not affect (for example) host-directed switching
between 80 and 132 columns in VT100/200/300 emulation.


<h3><a name="b817">817. Columns can be lost if K95G window wider than physical screen</a></h3>

In the GUI version of K95 (K95G.EXE), if the combination of font size and
number of columns produces a window that would be wider than the physical
screen, the columns that would extend beyond the right edge of the physical
screen are lost.  There is no horizontal scrolling feature to access them.
To avoid this effect, you must use a font-size/terminal-width combination
that fits on the physical screen.  Another workaround is also possible:

<ol>
<li> Create an 80-column K95G window with the desired font and point size.
<li> Use the mouse to make the font narrower by dragging the right edge
of the window leftwards.
<li> Give a SET TERMINAL WIDTH command to change to the desired number
of columns.
</ol>
Note: the Console version does support a form of horizontal scrolling,
as described here: <a href="scroll.html">scroll.html</a>

<h3><a name="b818">818. Ghost tool tips</a></h3>

I don't know if this is a bug in Kermit 95 or in Windows, but in Vista and
probably also Windows 7, when you bring K95 to the front by clicking in its
main screen, a ghost tool tip from the previous application is floating on
the Kermit screen.  It can be removed by clicking on it or by moving the
mouse off the screen and back on.  (Later I found that the same thing
happens between two other applications with K95 not involved; it's annoying,
but it's not Kermit.)

<h3><a name="b819">819. CVTDATE function cannot process deltas with negative months</a></h3>

The CVTDATE function cannot process a delta with negative months.
For example,

<pre>

<h3><a name="b821">821. Receiving files with non-ascii names can result in garbled filenames</a></h3>

Receiving a file named "Gr��e" may result in a saved file called something like
"Grü�\237e". There are likely two factors that contribute to this problem:

<ol>
    <li>The Kermit Protocol has
        <a href="https://kermitproject.org/cktodolist.html#filenames">no way of
            transmitting the encoding of a filename</a> - its just sent
        verbatim and if the sender and receiver happen to use different
        encodings for filenames then you end up with a mess.
    </li>
    <li>K95 does not call the Unicode versions of the File Open APIs on Windows,
        so even if the filename happened arrive UCS-2 encoded we're not passing
        a UCS-2 string to the operating system when creating the file.

Probably related to <a href="#b663">bug 663</a>, in K95 2.1.3 the the terminal
screen is cleared the first time you move the K95G window regardless of how
you started it. This bug is finally squashed for good in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b827">827. Making the K95G window larger in any dimension than the primary display introduces blank space</a></h3>

On a computer with multiple displays of different resolutions, in K95 2.1.3 if
you resize the terminal window to be larger in any dimension than the primary
display the extra area in that dimension is just white space. Fixed in version 3.0.

<h3><a name="b831">831. On Windows NT 3.50 for Alpha, K95G causes Windows to crash</a></h3>
<p>When K95G is started on Windows NT 3.50 for DEC Alpha, the Win32 subsystem
    begins malfunctioning so badly the computer is immediately unusable. If it
    doesn't crash entirely causing a Blue Screen, the only way to recover is to
    power cycle or reboot the machine yourself.
</p>

<p>This is a bug in Windows NT 3.50 - a user mode application such as Kermit 95
    should not be able to bring down the operating system. While there may be
    something specific that K95 is doing to cause this issue, given the limited
    demand for Kermit 95 on this platform it isn't really worth investigating
    developing a workaround for this problem. As of 3.0 beta 7, K95 for this
    platform is console-mode only (no K95G).

<h3><a name="b832">832. K95G crashes on exit if a connection is active and GUI dialogs are off</a></h3>
<p>
    If you try to close the K95G window either with the [X] button, or the
    File -&gt; Exit menu item while a connection is active and GUI dialogs are
    turned off (<tt>set gui dialogs off</tt> or Actions -&gt; GUI Dialogs),
    instead of asking if you want to exit K95G stops responding and must be
    terminated with task manager.
</p>

<p>This bug affects K95G 2.1.3 and likely all GUI versions of K95G going back
    to v2.0.
</p>

<p>At the moment the workaround is to leave GUI dialogs turned on, or disable
    the on-exit warning with <tt>set exit warning off</tt>
</p>

<p>This has been fixed in v3.0 - when closing the K95G window with the [X]
    button or the File -&gt; Exit menu item, GUI dialogs will always be used.

<h3><a name="b833">833. Scrollback search input box isn't visible if the terminal
        status line is turned off</a></h3>
<p>When you search within the scrollback buffer, the search field is shown
    in the terminal status line. If the terminal status line is turned off,
    the search field is invisible.
</p>
<p>
    The search does appear to still work but this may just be confusing if you
    don't know about it - you hit Alt+Left and nothing visibly changed but your
    keystrokes aren't going anywhere obvious now.

<h3><a name="b834">834. Switching between command and terminal via \Kexit doesn't toggle the toolbar button</a></h3>
<p>
    When switching between the command and terminal screens using the \Kexit
    kverb (Alt+X by default), the state of the associated toolbar button does
    not change. This can result in the toolbar button state getting out of sync.
</p>

<p>This bug affects K95G 2.1.3 and possibly earlier versions. Fixed in 3.0.

<h3><a name="b835">835. The SET HOST command does nothing when the network type is NETBIOS</a></h3>
<p>When using the NetBIOS network type under OS/2, the SET HOST command does nothing.
    <tt>SET HOST *</tt> does not listen for connections, and <tt>SET HOST foo</tt>
    does not connect to the host named foo. No output is produced in response to
    either command.
</p>

<p>Based on available code, Kermit 95 version 1.1.17 (June 1998) was the last
    release where NetBIOS support was likely to work on OS/2. By 1.1.19 of
    February 2000 (1.1.18 wasn't a public release), the code to make actually
    make or listen for NetBIOS connections was missing.
</p>

<p>Fixed in 3.0.</p>

<h3><a name="b836">836. Canceling an Auto-Download with Ctrl+C causes Kermit to crash or stop responding</a></h3>
<p>
    When canceling an autodownload with Ctrl+C, Kermit 95 either crashes or gets
    into a state where the file transfer is canceled but the File Transfer
    Display remains on screen with no way to exit it. The bug has been present
    since at least Kermit 95 v2.1, but may have been present in earlier releases
    as well.
</p>

<p>Fixed in 3.0.</p>
