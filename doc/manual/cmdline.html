<h2>Kermit 95 Command-Line Options</h2>

Command line options are operands given on the shell command line used
to start a program, such as K95, that can be processed by the program
after it starts.  For example:
<p><pre>
  C:\> <u>k95 -Y -l com2 -b 57600</u>
</pre><p>
Each letter preceded by a dash is an option. Command-line options are
case-sensitive; "-s" is different from "-S". Some options (like "-l" and "-b")
take arguments (like "com1" or "57600"), others (like "-Y") don't. When an
option does not require an argument it can be bundled with other options:
<p><pre>
  C:\> <u>k95 -Qis oofa.exe</u>
</pre><p>
<p>If an option contains spaces, it must be enclosed in doublequotes:
<p><pre>
   C:\> <u>k95.exe -s "filename with spaces"</u>
</pre>
<p>When any "action options" are included on the command line (such as <tt>-s</tt>
    to send a file), Kermit exits after executing its command-line options.
    If -S is included, or no action options were given, Kermit enters its
    interactive command parser and issues its prompt.

<p>Exceptions to the rules:
<ul>
<li>If the first command-line option is a filename, Kermit executes commands
    from the file.  Additional command-line options can follow the filename.
<li>The special option "=" (equal sign) or "--" (double hyphen) means to
    treat the rest of the command line as data, rather than commands; this
    data is placed in the argument vector array, \&@[], along with the other
    items on the command line, and also in the top-level \%1..\%9 variables.
<li>A similar option "+" (plus sign) means: the name of a Kermit script
    file follows.  This file is to be executed, and its name assigned to \%0
    and \&_[0].  All subsequent command-line arguments are to be ignored by
    Kermit but made available to the script as \%1, \%2, ..., as well as
    in the argument-vector arrays.  The initialization file is not executed
    automatically in this case.
<li>The -s option can accept multiple filenames, separated by spaces.
<li>the -j and -J options allow an optional second argument, the TCP port
    name or number.
</ul>

<p>To get help on all available command-line options, including those which
are not documented here, type <tt><u>help options all</u></tt> at the Kermit 95 prompt,
or type <tt><u>help option x</u></tt> to get help for option x.</p>

<p> Kermit also offers a selection of "extended command-line" options.
These begin with two dashes, followed by a keyword, and then, if the option
has arguments, a colon (:) or equal sign (=) followed by the argument.
Unlike single-letter options, extended option keywords aren't case-sensitive,
and they can be abbreviated to any length that still distinguishes them from
other extended-option keywords.  Example:
<p><pre>
   C:\> <u>k95.exe --banner:oofa.txt</u>
</pre>
<p>which designates the file oofa.txt to be printed upon startup, rather than
the built-in banner (greeting) text.  To obtain a list of available
extended options, type <tt><u>help extended-options ?</u></tt>.
To get help about all extended options, type <tt><u>help extended-options</u></tt>.
To get help about a particular extended option, type
<tt><u>help extended-option xxx</tt></u>, where "xxx" is the option keyword.

Command line Kermit 95 has in common with C-Kermit are
<a href="https://www.kermitproject.org/ck10commandref.html#commandline">documented here</a>.
This section lists only those options that are specific to K95.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>-l _<i>number</i></tt>
<dd>The <tt>-l</tt> option is normally used to specify the name of the
communications device to use.  However, if instead of a device name, you
give a number preceded by an underscore, e.g.:
<p>
<pre>
  k95 -l _1234
</pre>
<p>
this is interpreted as a Windows device handle for a communications connection
that has already been opened by another process.  This allows other programs
to make connections and then use Kermit 95 to peform selected tasks on them.
When K95 is started this way, it bypasses all device initialization and
conditioning, and it does not close the device when it exits.
<p>

<dt><tt>-j _<i>number</i></tt>
<dd>The <tt>-j</tt> <tt>_</tt><i>number</i> option is similar to <tt>-l</tt>
one, except a network connection is assumed for the open handle.  Kermit 95
is prepared to accept Telnet negotiations but does not initiate them.

<p>

<dt><tt>-J <i>host [ port ]</i></tt>
<dd>The <tt>-J</tt> command-line option makes Kermit 95 act just
like Telnet.  Follow the -J with whatever you would put on the Telnet command
line: host name or IP address, optionally followed by the service port name
or number, e.g.:
<p><pre>
  telnet oofa.com
  telnet martini.eecs.umich.edu 3000

  k95 -J oofa.com
  k95 -J martini.eecs.umich.edu 3000
</pre><p>
When started this way, Kermit 95 makes a Telnet connection to the host and
enters CONNECT (Terminal) mode automatically.  It lets you escape back and
reconnect any number of times (e.g. to transfer files or anything else you
want), but when the connection is broken (typically, when you log out of the
remote host or service), Kermit 95 exits and disappears automatically.
<p>
The <tt>TELNET.EXE</tt> and <tt>RLOGIN.EXE</tt> programs that come with Kermit
95 invoke K95.EXE in this way.
<p>
NOTE: OS/2 Telnet has a different command-line syntax; the <tt>TELNET.EXE</tt>
program that comes with Kermit/2 converts from OS/2 Telnet syntax to Kermit/2.
<p>
<dt><tt>-J <i>_number</i></tt>
<dt><tt>-J <i>$number</i></tt>
<dd>When started this way, K95 treats the number as a TCP/IP socket handle.
If the number is prefaced with an underscore, the socket is being used as
a telnet client connection.  If the number is prefaced by a U.S. currency 
(dollar) sign, the socket is being used as a telnet server connection.
<p>
<dt><tt>-# <i>number</i></tt>
<dd>Startup Flags.  Note: the <tt>#</tt> is literal, follow it by a number
(e.g. <tt>-#&nbsp;4</tt>).  The <i>number</i> is bit mapped, the sum of the
desired start options:
<p>
<pre>
   1 - Disable Win95 special fixes
   2 - Do not load optional network dlls
   4 - Do not load optional tapi dlls
   8 - Do not load optional kerberos dlls
  16 - Do not load optional zmodem dlls
  32 - Use stdin for input instead of the console
  64 - Use stdout for output instead of the console
 128 - Do not terminate process in response to Session Logoff
</pre>
<p>
Options 2, 4, 8, and 16 can be used to speed up K95 program load and
termination if you are not using the corresponding features, and/or to avoid
bugs in the corresponding DLLs (if you don't need to use them).
<p>
Options 32 and 64 are for interfacing K95 to other programs, such as screen
readers:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Redirection from/to pipe/file is automatically detected.
<p>
<li>When stdin is used, keymapping is effectively disabled.  In other words no
function keys, keypad differentiation, ...
<p>
<li>When stdout is used no scrollback, no colors, no cursor repositioning.
<p>
<li>When using standard output, terminal emulation is still supported for
responses to inquiries, printing, even screen reading, but it can not be
displayed properly on the screen.
<p>
<li>If a passthrough mode is desired for the terminal emulator, set terminal
type tty.
<p>
<li>Set command/terminal height/width affects the internal buffers and will
even be reported to the host if window size reports are active on the
current conection.  However, they will not change the window size.
<p>
<li>As 16-bit shells use intermediate files for pipes it is not possible to
pipe real time input in from another process from the shell command line.
</ul>
<p>
Option 128 is for use when K95 is started as a service on Windows NT or 
Windows 2000.
<p>
