<h3><a name="overview"><hr>Overview</h3>

Kermit 95 (K95) is a multipurpose communication software package for Windows
and OS/2.  The current version can make serial-port connections, modem
connections, and Internet and other types of network connections, all in a
uniform manner.  K95's Internet protocols include Telnet, Rlogin, SSH (Windows
only), FTP, and HTTP.  K95 comes in two versions: Graphical
User Interface (GUI) and Console.  The GUI version, called K95G, has
several features lacking in the Console version, such as menu, toolbar,
scroll bar, and font selection.  The features of the GUI version are
described <a href="k95gui.html">HERE</a>.

<p>

Kermit 95 offers:

<p>
<ul>

<li><b>Terminal emulation</b>
(serial-port, modem, LAT, Telnet, Rlogin, and SSH connections only):
Faithful emulation of <a
href="termtype.html">40 different kinds of terminals</a>, including the
ever-popular DEC VT100 series (up to and including the VT320), the Linux
console, ANSI, SCOANSI, various Wyse models, and so on, including scrollback,
colors, key mapping, key macros, and character-set translation.

<p>

<li><b>File Transfer.</b> Files can be transferred over a serial-port, modem,
SSH, Telnet, or Rlogin connection with the fastest and most advanced version
of the Kermit protocol available, as well as with Zmodem, Ymodem, Ymodem-G, or
Xmodem protocols.  Text files can also be captured or sent "raw" (without
protocol).  K95 can also use FTP and HTTP protocol to transfer files with
Internet FTP and Websites.

<p>

<li><b>File Management.</b> Kermit 95 includes most of the same capabilities
as the Windows Command prompt, but with more options and choices for managing
local PC files.  And client / server Kermit connections allow the Kermit client
(such as K95) to manage files on the Kermit server (e.g. on UNIX, VMS, or
Windows itself).

<p>

<li><b>Character-Set Conversion.</b>  Different kinds of computers use
different encodings for the same characters (accented letters, non-Roman
letters, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, etc.).  Kermit 95 knows how to convert them.
<a href="http://kermitproject.org/case14.html">CLICK HERE</a>
for an overview.
<a href="http://kermitproject.org/case08.html">AND HERE</a>

<p>

<li><b>Automation.</b> Kermit 95 includes its own built-in cross-platform
transport-independent scripting language to let you automate anything you
could do in K95 by hand, on any kind of connection.
<a href="http://kermitproject.org/k95scripts.html">CLICK HERE</a> to
visit the Kermit script library, where you can find a script-writing tutorial
and lots of sample scripts.

<p>

<li><b>Security</b> (network connections only).  Kermit 95 supports <a
href="sshclien.html">SSH v2</a>, Secure
Telnet, Secure Login (Kerberos Rlogin), and SSL/TLS connection methods, as
well as <a href="security.html">four IETF
standard authentication methods</a>: Kerberos IV, Kerberos V, X.509
certificates, and SRP.

<p>

<li><b>Remote Access</b>.  In Windows NT, 2000, XP and newer, Kermit 95 can be
installed as a service that accepts incoming Internet connections, performs
secure authentication, and offers a secure file-transfer and management
shell and/or server.  Also included is a "host mode" script that works in
all versions of Windows and supports both dialin and Internet connections.

</ul>
<p>

See the <a href="http://kermitproject.org/k95.html">K95 home page</a>
for a more complete list of features.

<p>

<b>Kermit 95 comes in two pieces</b>: a graphical <i>Dialer</i>, which sets up
and launches connections, and K95 itself, the communications and scripting
engine that actually makes and uses them.

<h3><a name="dialer"><hr>The Dialer</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>

The Dialer lets you make connections without having to
type any commands.  You don't have to use the Dialer at all if you don't want
to, as explained in the <a href="#command">next section</a>.  But if you would
rather not learn or deal with commands, you should use the Dialer.
</i>
</blockquote>

<p>

You can invoke the Dialer in two ways: from the desktop and from the Dial
button (or, equivalently, File&rarr;Connections on the menu) on the K95G
Toolbar.

<p>

The K95 Dialer is not just for dialing.  It is a graphical user interface
(GUI) for setting up and launching connections of all kinds: direct serial,
dialed, Telnet, Rlogin, SSH, or FTP, simply by checking boxes, pushing
buttons, selecting from lists, and filling out forms.  You can launch one,
two, three, four, or more simultaneous connections from a single copy of the
Dialer.

<p>

The easiest way to <b>define a new connection</b> is to Right-Click one of the
Templates (such as "Linux-SSH", "AIX-Telnet", or "Dialup-VT100"), choose
<b>Clone</b>, give the connection a name, and then fill in the connection
details -- usually just host name or address, or telephone number.

<p>

If you want more control over the many possible settings and customizations,
choose <b>Connections</b> on the menu bar, and then <b>Add</b>.  This results
in a series of Settings pages -- forms for you to fill out, similar to a
Windows "wizard".  On the first page, give a name to the connection, choose
the connection type, and give the details (phone number or network address).
Then fill out, check, or change the information on each of the subsequent
pages.  When you click [Save/Next] on the bottom of the first page, the new
entry is added to the database and the Dialer moves to the next page.  When
you click [Cancel] on the first page, the entry is not added.  For subsequent
pages, [Save/Next] saves the current page and goes to the next; [Cancel]
cancels the current page, but the entry remains.  (If this seems a bit
awkward, it's due to <a href="newdial.html">resources limitations in Windows
9x</a>.)

<p>

The Connections menu and the Right-Click popup menu
also let you <b>remove</b> entries, <b>edit</b> them, generate desktop
<b>shortcuts</b> for them, and so on.

<p>

The other Toolbar buttons do the expected things: CONNECT makes a connection
to the highlighted entry; Hangup closes the connection (if any) associated
with the highlighted entry; Quick lets you make a connection for which there
is no entry; and Shortcut creates a desktop shortcut for the highlighted
entry.

<p>

<b>Make a connection</b> by highlighting the desired entry and then clicking
the CONNECT button.  Or double-click on the desired entry.  You can use
the Dialer to start and control as many simultaneous connections as you wish.


<h3><a name="gui"><hr>The Graphical User Interface</h3>

As of version 2.0, the graphical version of Kermit 95, K95G, has a menu bar,
toolbar, operational title-bar controls, a scrollbar, font selections, and can
be resized with the mouse.  The features of the new graphical user interface
are described in detail <a href="k95gui.html">HERE</a>.  The K95G menu,
toolbar, and other graphical screen elements, give you point-and-click access
to many of K95's important settings and functions.

<h3><a name="command"><hr>The Command Interface</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>

The purpose of the command interface is to give you fine-grained, precise,
realtime control over every aspect of Kermit 95's operation and, perhaps more
importantly, to allow you to automate complex or repetitive tasks by writing
programs consisting of Kermit commands.  If this does not interest you, you
can stick with the Dialer.

</i>
</blockquote>

<p>

The program that actually makes the connection and then lets you use it is
<tt>K95G.EXE</tt> (or K95.EXE if you rather not use the graphical version).
When you launch a connection with the Dialer, it starts
<tt>K95G.EXE</tt> for you, feeding it the appropriate commands.  Each copy of
<tt>K95G.EXE</tt> can have one connection open at a time.  To have multiple
simultaneous connections, run multiple copies of <tt>K95G.EXE</tt>.

<p>

If you used the Kermit 95 installation process to put K95 on your computer, you
can start <tt>K95G.EXE</tt> directly, without using the Dialer, by
double-clicking on the "Kermit 95" desktop icon (if you chose to create it at
install time).
Another way is from the <i>Start</i> <tt>-&#62;</tt> <i> Programs</i> menu, if
you elected to list Kermit 95 there when you installed it.  Another way is in
the <i>Start</i> <tt>-&#62;</tt> <i>Run</i> dialog.  Another way is from a
Command window.

<p>

When <tt>K95G.EXE</tt> starts, it automatically reads and executes commands
from its standard initialization file, <tt>K95.INI</tt>, and also from your
Kermit 95 customization file, <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt>.  These are plain-text
files that can be edited with Notepad or other plain-text editor.
Add or change anything you like in <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt>, but we recommend you
leave <tt>K95.INI</tt> alone.  See the <a href="readme.html">README</a>
for the locations of these and other files.

<p>

<tt>K95G.EXE</tt> has a prompt-and-command interface.  If you haven't
used Kermit software before, this might seem old-fashioned to you, but in fact
it's far more powerful, flexible, and easy to use than a GUI program of equal
complexity once you learn it:

<p>
<ul>
<li>It's less labor-intensive.
<li>Its command language <i>is</i> its scripting language.
</ul>
<p>

And perhaps contrary to first impressions, it <i>is</i> friendly.  It gives
you a "menu" whenever you ask for one (by typing a question mark anywhere
within a command) and it has loads of built-in help text.

<p>

When Kermit 95 is ready for a command, it prints its prompt on the screen.
Kermit 95's prompt looks like this:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\Program Files\Kermit 95\] K-95&gt; _
</pre>
<p>

The current directory is shown within brackets.  If you don't know what to
do, type "help" (the letters h, e, l, p, and then press the Enter key).
Type "intro" for a brief introduction to K95's commands.  To get help about
a specific command, type "help" and then the command name, for example
"help directory".

<p>

You can use the Up-Arrow and Down-Arrow keys in the Command screen only
to scroll back and forth through the command history, e.g. to recall a
previous command so you don't have to type it again.  (In the Terminal screen,
arrow keys do whatever the emulated terminal's arrow keys do.)

<p>

<b>Let's look at the common ways to make a connection.</b>  Let's do
<b>Telnet</b> first because it's so easy.  In our examples, what you type is
underlined, and must be terminated by pressing the Enter key.

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>telnet hq.xyzcorp.com</u>  
</pre>
<p>

(Substitute the IP hostname or address of the
host you actually want to Telnet to.)  That's all there is to it.  Up pops
the "blue screen" and the host's login prompt.  (Note: we refer to the Terminal
screen as the "blue screen" because it is blue by default, but you can
choose any color scheme you want for any screen.)

<p>

<a href="sshclien.html">SSH</a> works approximately the same way as Telnet:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>ssh hq.xyzcorp.com</u>  
</pre>
<p>

Except that if your username on the target computer is not the same as your
Windows username, you have to include it as part of the SSH command:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>ssh hq.xyzcorp.com /user:olga</u>
</pre>
<p>

Now let's do a <b>dialed connection</b>.  In this case, you have to give some
additional details (as you would to any other modem program):

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>set port tapi</u>
  K-95&gt; <u>set speed 57600</u>
  K-95&gt; <u>dial 7654321</u>
</pre>
<p>

The "set port tapi" command tells K95 to access the modem through Microsoft's
Telephony Application Program Interface (TAPI).  This way, any modem that is
listed in the Windows Control Panel Modems folder can be dialed by K95.
Substitute the actual phone number for 7654321.  If the connection is made
successfully, the "blue screen" pops up, and you can log in or whatever else is
expected by the computer or service on the other end of the call.  If the call
failed, you get an informative error message such as NO ANSWER or BUSY.

<p>

Instead of "set port tapi", of course you can also try the traditional
DOS-like method, but whether it works depends on your PC hardware
and Windows configurations:

<p>
<pre>
  K-95&gt; <u>set modem type usrobotics</u>
  K-95&gt; <u>set port com1</u>
  K-95&gt; <u>set speed 57600</u>
  K-95&gt; <u>dial 7654321</u>
</pre>
<p>

Of course there many more options and a great many troubleshooting techniques,
but this is only a tutorial.  For a summary of Kermit commands, see the <a
href="http://kermitproject.org/ckututor.html">C-Kermit Manual Page and
Tutorial</a>. If you have questions, you can ask them on Github:

<h3><a name="terminal"><hr>Terminal Sessions</h3>

When the Terminal screen is showing,
your keyboard and screen are connected to the
remote computer.  K95G users should read the <a href="k95gui.html">GUI Features
Document</a> to find out how to use GUI controls to customize the size, shape,
and colors of the Terminal screen.

<p>

You can get back to the
command prompt with <i>Alt-X</i> (hold down the Alt and Shift keys and press
the X key).  You can get back to the Terminal screen (as long there is a
connection) by using <i>Alt-X</i> again.  In other words, <i>Alt-X</i> goes
back and forth between the terminal screen and the command screen.
In K95G, you can also use the second Toolbar button (the one with two arrows)
for this.

<p>
<blockquote>
<i>

Kermit's Alt-Shift-key combinations are available in all emulations (except in
PCTERM keyboard mode).  In most emulations (including VTxxx), you don't have
to use the Shift key, but in others (QNX, SCOANSI, HFT, etc) you must use the
Shift key because unshifted Alt-key combinations are used in those emulations.
In short: If <i>Alt-X</i> and <i>Alt-H</i> don't work, try again with the
Shift key held down.

<p>

An alternative method of getting back to the prompt is to type Ctrl-<tt>]</tt>
(hold down the Ctrl key and press the right-bracket key), and then press the
C key.  This should work no matter what terminal is being emulated.

</i>
</blockquote>
<p>

<i>Alt-H</i> in the terminal screen (or any other screen) pops up a
context-sensitive menu of some of the many "hot keys" that are available, and
what they do.  Press the Space bar to make the menu go away.  The <i>Alt-H</i>
screen reveals several other important keys:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Page Up</i></dt>
<dd>Scrolls the current screen (Terminal or Command) back one screen.
<p>

<dt><i>Page Down</i></dt>
<dd>Scrolls the current screen down one screen (if not already at the bottom).
<p>

<dt><i>Home</i></dt>
<dd>Scrolls the current screen to the top of the scrollback buffer.
<p>

<dt><i>End</i></dt>
<dd>Scrolls the current screen to the bottom of the scrollback buffer.
<p>

<dt><i>Ctrl-Page Up</i></dt>
<dd>(Hold down the Ctrl key and press the Page Up key) Scrolls the current
screen (Terminal or Command) back one line.
<p>

<dt><i>Ctrl-Page Down</i></dt>
<dd>Scrolls the current screen down one line (if not already at the bottom).
<p>

<dt><i>Alt-P</i></dt>
<dd>Sends the contents of the current screen to the printer.
</dl>

<p>

You can <b>copy and paste with the mouse</b>, but Kermit 95 uses its own
built-in mouse handling for this.  To copy, simply sweep the mouse across the
desired text with the left button held down.  The text to be copied is
highlighted.  When you let go of the mouse, the text is copied to the
clipboard.

<p>

You can <b>paste</b> into the Terminal screen with <i>Shift-Insert</i>.  This
sends the text from the clipboard to the host.  You can also copy and paste
simultaneously within the Terminal screen, thus transmitting some existing
text on the Terminal screen back to the host; to do this, hold down the Ctrl
key and drag the desired text with left mouse button depressed.  When you let
go of the button, the text is transmitted.  Of course there are many other
mouse options; see the third <i>Alt-h</i> screen for a list.

<p>

You can change key mappings with SET KEY or SET TERMINAL KEY, and display
with SHOW KEY.


<h3><a name="transfer"><hr>File Transfer</h3>

This is another big topic, so we'll just look at the easiest way.  Let's
assume you are connected to a UNIX host (UNIX includes Linux, Solaris, AIX,
HP-UX, FreeBSD, etc etc) which has <a href="http://kermitproject.org/ckermit.html">C-Kermit</a> or <a
href="http://kermitproject.org/gkermit.html">G-Kermit</a> installed.
Kermit 95 is in its Terminal screen and the host's shell prompt indicates it is
ready for you to type a shell command.  Then:

<p>

<b>To download a file</b> (send it from the host to your PC), type the
following command at the host's shell prompt:
<p>
<pre>
  kermit -s <i>filename</i>
</pre>
<p>

where <i>filename</i> is the name of the file or files you want to download
and "<tt>-s</tt>" means "send".  Kermit 95 takes care of the rest
automatically.

<p>

<b>To upload a file</b> (get it from your PC to the host computer), type the
following command at the host's shell prompt:

<p>
<pre>
  kermit -g <i>filename</i>
</pre>
<p>

where <i>filename</i> is the name of the file or files you want to upload.  If
the <i>filename</i> contains wildcards (like "<tt>*</tt>") you'll have to
enclose the filename in double-quotes.  "<tt>-g</tt>" means "get".  Kermit 95
sends the desired files automatically.

<p>

If C-Kermit is not installed on the host, try G-Kermit (substitute "gkermit"
for "kermit" in the commands).  If neither is installed, you can install them
yourself (see links below).  Or else try Zmodem ("sz <i>filename</i>" to
download but for uploading it's a bit more complicated).

<h3><a name="security"><hr>Security</h3>

Kermit 95 includes optional secure authentication and strong encryption
features for use in organizations with centrally managed security.  Secure
connections in Kermit 95 require
<i>(a)</i> a secure version of Kermit 95;
<!--<i>(b)</i> access to a host that supports Kerberos IV, Kerberos V, SSL/TSL, or-->
<!--SRP security; and-->
<i>(b)</i> access to a host that supports Kerberos V or SSL/TSL security; and
<i>(c)</i> configuration of Kermit 95 to use the appropriate security method
on the host and to provide the host with any required information.  This is
not generally something that an end user would do; rather, it would be done
centrally, e.g. at a university or company.  Setup and use of K95's security options are
thoroughly documented <a href="security.html">HERE</a>; this document is
intended mainly for system and/or network administrators.

<p>

As of version 1.1.21 (April 2002) Kermit 95 includes full SSH
capability.  <a href="sshclien.html">CLICK HERE</a> for complete details.

<h3><a name="hostmode"><hr>Remote Access</h3>

Kermit 95 comes with a "host mode" script that allows you to set up
text-mode menu-driven access for others to access your Windows PC, either
by dialing it up or by making a Telnet connection to it.  
<a href="http://kermitproject.org/k95host.html">CLICK HERE</a> for an

Now there is also a new remote access server, the Windows Kermit Internet
Service Daemon (WIKSD), available only for Windows NT, 2000, and XP, and
usable only from the Internet (not direct dialup).  Here's the information:

<h3><a name="documentation"><hr>Documentation</h3>

Kermit 95 documentation consists of:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>The Kermit 95 Manual</b>

<dd>In your K95 <tt>DOCS\MANUAL</tt> directory in HTML format, included with
all copies of Kermit 95.  When you install Kermit 95, desktop shortcuts and/or
Start Menu items are created (if you wish), and you can also access it from
the Dialer's Help menu or K95G's Help menu.  This manual concentrates on the
Windows-specific aspects of Kermit 95: the Dialer, terminal emulation, key
mapping, mouse usage, printing, and so on.
