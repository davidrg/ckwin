<p>

<b>The Windows Internet Kermit Service Daemon (WIKSD) for Windows NT, 2000,
and XP</b> from the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/index.html">Kermit
Project</a> at Columbia University lets anybody with a suitable Telnet client
make connections and log in to an Internet-connected Windows PC and download,
upload, and manage files.  WIKSD is a self-contained, user-friendly, text-mode
file-transfer and -management shell that can be accessed by Telnet using
either clear-text or secure authentication methods.  Here are the kinds of
things that WIKSD can do (within your logged-in access rights):

<p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer files to and from your Telnet client
(if your Telnet client supports Kermit protocol), including:
<ul>
<li>Automatic text/binary mode switching
<li>Recursive directory traversal
<li>Recovery of interrupted transfers
<li>Atomic file movement
<li>Text-file record-format and character-set conversion
<li>File timestamp preservation and update mode
</ul>
<li>Produce directory listings
<li>Display (TYPE) file contents or pieces of files
<li>Search files for strings or patterns
<li>Copy, rename, and delete files
<li>Select files for transfer, deletion, etc, using flexible criteria
<li>Change directories
<li>Create and delete directories
<li>Open, close, read, and write files
<li>Perform arithmetic (integer, floating-point, date/time)
<li>Convert text-file character sets
<li>Execute programs written in the Kermit language to automate all the above
<li>Act as a server to IKSD-aware clients
</ul>

<p>

Thus automation is possible through any combination of server-side and
client-side scripts.  IKSD-aware clients (such as <a
href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95.html">Kermit 95</a> and <a
href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html">C-Kermit</a>) can even make
remote procedure calls, pass variables back and forth, etc.

<p>

Here are the kinds of things WIKSD does <b><i>not</i></b> do:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Execute "DOS" (Windows Command Window) commands
<li>Run external programs
<li>Let you at the Windows shell
<li>Show you what the PC's real screen looks like
<li>Make connections to other computers
<li>Act as a terminal emulator
<li>Act as a gateway, router, or proxy server
</ul>

<p>

Thus <b>WIKSD fills the same role as an FTP server</b>, but with some
important differences:

<p>
<ul>
<li>It uses Kermit protocol rather than FTP protocol, and therefore
has more features, flexibility, and power than an FTP server;
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/iksd.html#x1">CLICK HERE</a>
for details.
<li>You can interact with it directly if you wish.
<li>Complex or repetitive tasks can be automated.
</ul>

<p>


<b>WIKSD is not available for Windows 95, 98, or ME</b> for security reasons
and because those operating systems do not support background services.

<p>

WIKSD is a specially configured version of <a
href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95.html">Kermit 95</a> (K95).  As such,
it has most of the same commands as Kermit 95 itself, as well as its cousins
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html">C-Kermit</a> on UNIX,
VMS, and other platforms, and <a
href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/mskermit.html">MS-DOS Kermit</a> on DOS
and Windows 3.x.  Internet Kermit servers are also available for UNIX, such as
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/cuiksd.html">THIS ONE</a> at the
Kermit Project.

use them.  For further information, you can also consult:

<h3><a name="x2"><hr>2. INTERACTIVE USE</a></h3>

[ <a href="#top">Top</a> ]
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]

[ <a href="#x1">Previous</a> ]
<p>

WIKSD can be accessed from any Telnet client that lets you specify TCP
port 1649 (the "kermit" service, assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority, IANA):

<p>
<pre>
  telnet olga.xyzcorp.com 1649
</pre>
<p>

But for reasons that will emerge shortly, some Telnet programs make better
WIKSD clients than others.  The ideal Telnet client for this purpose:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Includes a Kermit file-transfer protocol implementation
<li>Supports Kermit protocol autoupload and autodownload
<li>Supports the Telnet Kermit Option (<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2839.txt">RFC2839</a>)
</ul>
<p>

Late-model Kermit programs (K95 and C-Kermit) also include an IKSD command,
which is the same as the TELNET command, but chooses port 1649 ("kermit")
rather than port 23 ("telnet"):

<p>
<pre>
  iksd olga.xyzcorp.com
</pre>
<p>

If you are using C-Kermit or Kermit 95 as your client, and you are making
a connection to a server where you must log in with a different user ID
than the one on your client, use one of the following forms:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>telnet /user:olaf olga.xyzcorp.com 1649</tt></dt>
<dd>Specifies the User ID in a switch to the TELNET command.
<p>

<dt><tt>telnet /user:olaf olga.xyzcorp.com kermit</tt></dt>
<dd>Same as the previous example but using the service name "kermit"
rather than the port number 1649.  This works if "kermit" is listed in
your local TCP services file.  If it doesn't work, you'll have to use
the port number.
<p>

<dt><tt>iks /user:olaf olga.xyzcorp.com</tt></dt>
<dd>Same as previous, but using IKSD command instead of TELNET,
which makes a connection to the Kermit Service port (1649)
instead of the Telnet port (23).
<p>

<dt><tt>iks /user: olga.xyzcorp.com</tt></dt>
<dd>Same as previous, but here we tell Kermit to use a blank User ID,
which forces a User ID prompt so you can enter it from the keyboard.
<p>

<dt><tt>iks /user:anonymous olga.xyzcorp.com</tt></dt>
<dd>Makes an anonymous connection to the Kermit Service, if the service
has been configured to allow it.

</dl>
<p>

All of the forms shown above give you an interactive terminal session to
the IKSD command processor.  If you want make a scripted and/or client/server
connection, use the "set host" command, explained in
<a href="#x4">Section 4</a> and <a href="#x5">Section 5</a>.

<p>

Once you make the connection, you receive Username: prompt (if the username was
not already sent ahead) and a Password: prompt.  If the owner of the PC has
furnished you with an ID, use it.  If not, you can try a user name of
"anonymous" (and use your email address as the password).  Anonymous logins
are permitted at the discretion of the PC owner.  Example (the parts you type
are <u>underlined</u>):

<p>
<pre>
  Username: <u>anonymous</u>           <i>(To log in anonymously)</i>
  Password: <u>olaf@abccorp.com</u>    <i>(Supply your email address as password)</i>
</pre>
<p>

When logging in as a real user, the security of the login depends on your
client and the configuration of the server.  In the worst case, your password
is sent in the clear over the Internet (as it would be with a regular Telnet
connection):

<p>
<pre>
  Username: <u>olga</u>                <i>(Type user ID, then press Return or Enter)</i>
  Password: <u>secret</u>              <i>(Password doesn't echo)</i>
</pre>
<p>

In the best case, the login is secured by protocols such as Kerberos 4,
Kerberos 5, TLS, SRP, or (Windows-to-Windows connections) NTLM.  Consult the
documentation of your Telnet client to find out if it supports the same forms
of security that the server offers, and if so, how to use them.  When secure
methods are used, you might not need to supply your username or password.
WIKSD tells which security methods it has available if you give it the SHOW
AUTHENTICATION command.  Ditto for K95 and C-Kermit clients.  Security is
covered in <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/security.html">a separate
document</a>.

<p>
<blockquote>
<i>

<b>NOTE:</b> When you log in as a real user, your <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> is
executed.  Certain K95 commands are not accepted by WIKSD, so you should
structure your <tt>K95CUSTOM.INI</tt> file not to execute them if K95 is
acting as WIKSD.  <a href="wiksd.html">CLICK HERE</a> for details.

</i>
</blockquote>
<p>

The owner of the server PC also decides which directories you can access and
what access rights you have.  If you log in to WIKSD as a real user in Windows
NT, 2000, or XP, your initial current directory is the "home folder" from
your user profile, and you have all the same access rights you would have if
you had logged in any other way.  The PC owner has the ability (and the
right) to log your activities in the NT Event Log to any desired level of
detail.

<p>

To log out from WIKSD, give any of the following commands: LOGOUT, EXIT,
or QUIT.  Or simply have your Telnet client close the connection.

<p>

While logged in, you are presented with the Kermit 95's IKSD prompt, similar to
the "DOS" or Command prompt:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\OLGA\] IKSD&gt;
</pre>
<p>

(your current disk and directory are shown in brackets).

<p>

K95 (as WIKSD) offers a wide range of file management and transfer functions
in a friendly and helpful interactive command-line interface.  Like the
Windows Command window:

<p>
<ul>

<li>K95 prints a prompt and waits for you to type a command.

<li>K95's default prompt shows the current directory.

<li>Commands are English verbs like HELP, COPY, and DELETE, or well-known
"computer verbs" like CD (Change Directory) and MKDIR (Make a Directory).

<li>Commands can include multiple "fields" separated by spaces.

<li>Commands can have "switches" (modifiers).

<li>Commands can be edited before execution.

<li>Commands are executed when you press the Return or Enter key.

<li>Commands can be executed from a file.
</ul>
<p>

Unlike the Windows Command window:

<p>
<ul>

<li>K95 has built-in help text for each command (e.g. "help copy").

<li>K95 lets you abbreviate commands.

<li>K95 gives you context-sensitive help about each field of each command
if you type "<tt>?</tt>" (question mark).

<li>K95 completes keywords and filenames automatically if you type Esc or Tab.

<li>K95 lets you recall previous commands.

<li>K95 lets you define and execute macros.

<li>In fact, K95 includes a whole programming language, complete with
built-in and user-defined variables, arrays, and functions,
decision-making, loops, and all the rest.

</ul>
<p>

And:

<p>
<ul>

<li>K95 lets you transfer files.

</ul>

<h3><a name="x2.1"><hr>2.1. K95 as a Windows Shell</a></h3>

Let's begin by looking at K95 as an alternative to the Windows Command shell.
How does it stack up against the regular Command Window?  First, note that K95
does not offer system management commands, disk formatting, and so on.  These
should be used only from the PC's real keyboard and screen by the PC's owner.
Second, it cannot be used for starting or running external programs; this is
mainly for security reasons.

<p>
<blockquote>
<i>

The term "DOS" (Disk Operating System) is used in this document to refer to
the text-mode command-and-prompt interface and command repertoire of the
Windows Command Window.  The proper name for this window varies from one
Windows release to the next ("MS-DOS Prompt", "Console Window", "Command
Window", etc), but the usage and command repertoire is about the same, with
certain differences (e.g. to delete a directory tree, one shell might have
no command at all, another might use DELTREE, and still another might use
DEL /S).

</i>
</blockquote>
<p>

Here is a side-by-side comparison keyed on common DOS commands, DOS on the
left, K95 on the right.  Slanted square brackets enclose optional fields.
Italic words are parameters that you would replace by actual values, for
example "<i>disk-letter</i>" might be replaced by "<tt>C</tt>".  In case you
are wondering why Kermit commands are not identical to DOS commands, it's
because <i>(a)</i> Kermit runs on many platforms, not just Windows, and tries
to maintain common syntax in all versions, and <i>(b)</i> Kermit predates
both DOS and Windows.

<p>
<pre>
  <u>Windows Command</u>                <u>K95 Command</u>
  <i>disk-letter</i>:                   CD <i>disk-letter</i>:
  CD <i>directory</i>                   CD <i>[[disk</i>:<i>][directory]]</i>
  CD                             PWD
  <i>(none)</i>                         BACK
</pre>
<p>

Notes: In K95, CD given with no operand returns to the default or home
directory, whereas in DOS it prints the name of the current directory.  Unlike
in DOS, a disk letter can be included in K95's CD command.  Use PWD to display
the current directory.  K95 also has a BACK command to return to the previous
directory.  Type HELP CD at the <tt>IKSD&gt;</tt> prompt for more information.

<p>
<pre>
  <u>Windows Command</u>                <u>K95 Command</u>
  CHKDSK <i>[disk-letter]</i>           SPACE <i>[disk-letter]</i>
</pre>
<p>

Note: K95's SPACE command doesn't check the disk; it shows how much
space is used and free without checking the disk.  CHKDSK is a true DOS
command, not available in most Windows shells.

<p>
<pre>
  <u>Windows Command</u>                <u>K95 Command</u>
  COPY <i>[options]</i> <i>source dest</i>     COPY <i>[options]</i> <i>source dest</i>
</pre>
<p>

Notes: K95 COPY has more options, including some you might not expect,
like for Base64 encoding and decoding, byte-swapping, etc.  K95 also has
a TRANSLATE command, which is like COPY, but it converts the file's
character set.  HELP COPY and HELP TRANSLATE for more information.

<p>
<pre>
  <u>Windows Command</u>                <u>K95 Command</u>
  DATE                           DATE [<i>date</i>]
</pre>
<p>

Notes: K95 DATE does not set the date, it only shows it (and the time).  If
you give it a date or time or date-time operand (in almost any format), it
gives it back to you in standard format.  It can also be used to do date/time
arithmetic, e.g. "date 1 january 2002 +1000days".  HELP DATE for details.

<p>
<pre>
  <u>Windows Command</u>                <u>K95 Command</u>
  DEL <i>[options]</i> <i>filespec</i>         DELETE <i>[options]</i> <i>filespec</i>
  DELTREE <i>[options]</i> <i>filespec</i>     DELETE /TREE <i>[options]</i> <i>filespec</i>
</pre>
<p>

Note: K95 DELETE has more options, including file selection by date and/or
size, exception lists, etc.  It can also delete selected or all files
recursively (i.e. down through subdirectories), and therefore also stands
in for DELTREE.  HELP DELETE for details.

<p>
<pre>
  <u>Windows Command</u>                <u>K95 Command</u>
  DIR <i>[options]</i> [<i>filespec</i>]       DIRECTORY <i>[options]</i> [<i>filespec</i>]
</pre>
<p>

Note: K95 DIRECTORY has many more options, including selection options,
listing options, sorting options, and (like DOS DIR /S) can operate
recursively.  HELP DIRECTORY to read about all the options.

<p>
<pre>
  <u>Windows Command</u>                <u>K95 Command</u>
  EXIT                           EXIT <i>[ status [ message ] ]</i>
  FIND <i>[options]</i> "<i>string</i>" <i>file</i>   FIND <i>[options]</i> "<i>string</i>" <i>file</i> 
  MORE <i>file</i>                      MORE <i>[options]</i> <i>file</i>
  PRINT <i>[options]</i> <i>file</i>           PRINT <i>[options]</i> <i>file</i>
  PROMPT <i>string</i>                  SET PROMPT <i>string</i>
  RENAME <i>source</i> <i>dest</i>             RENAME <i>[options]</i> <i>source</i> <i>dest</i>
  MKDIR <i>directory</i>                MKDIR <i>directory</i>
  RMDIR <i>directory</i>                RMDIR <i>directory</i>
  TIME                           DATE [<i>date-and/or-time</i>]
  TYPE <i>file</i>                      TYPE <i>[options]</i> <i>file</i>
  <i>(none)</i>                         HEAD <i>[options]</i> <i>file</i>
  <i>(none)</i>                         TAIL <i>[options]</i> <i>file</i>
</pre>
<p>

Note: K95 TYPE has numerous options, governing paging, selection of lines,
and even character-set translation.  The K95 FIND command also searches for
patterns, not just literal strings, and has many options, including recursive
(subdirectory) searches, and can also be invoked as GREP (as in UNIX) or
SEARCH (as in VMS).  Type HELP for any of these commands (or any other command)
for a description of the syntax and purpose of the command.

<p>

K95 also has all the capabilities of DOS Batch (in the following list,
<i>commands</i> means one or more commands, separated by commas):

<p>
<pre>
  <u>Windows Command</u>                <u>K95 Command</u>
  CALL <i>file [ parameters ]</i>       TAKE <i>file [ parameters ]</i>
  ECHO <i>text</i>                      ECHO <i>text</i>
  FOR <i>var</i> IN <i>set</i> DO <i>command</i>      FOR <i>var init final increment</i> { <i>commands</i> }
  GOTO <i>label</i>                     GOTO <i>label</i>
  IF <i>condition command</i>           IF <i>condition</i> { <i>commands</i> } ELSE { <i>commands</i> }
  PAUSE <i>seconds</i>                  PAUSE <i>seconds-or-time-of-day</i>
  REM                            COMMENT or ; or #
  SHIFT                          SHIFT <i>[ number ]</i>
  <i>(none)</i>                         WHILE <i>condition</i> { <i>commands</i> }
  <i>(none)</i>                         SWITCH <i>v</i> { <i>case-statements</i> }
</pre>
<p>

Plus lots more (command recall, keyword abbreviation, filename and keyword
completion, context-sensitive help, etc, plus the substantive features of IKSD
itself, which are the topic of the rest of this document).

<h3><a name="x2.2"><hr>2.2. How to Enter K95 Commands</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<i>

The demo server listed in this section, <tt>iks.kermit.columbia.edu</tt>,
is not in service yet; therefore this section is for future reference only.

</i>
</blockquote>
<p>

Let's illustrate some of K95's basic features in a real session.  Use your
favorite Telnet client to make a connection to the public Windows Internet
Kermit Service at the Kermit Project (the parts you type are
<u>underlined</u>):

<p>
<pre>
  <u>telnet iks.kermit.columbia.edu 1649</u>
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
  Username: <u>anonymous</u>
  Password: <u>myname@myhost.com</u>
</pre>
<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt;
</pre>
<p>

The last line is the prompt.  The current disk and directory appear in
brackets on the left margin, and "<tt>IKSD&gt;</tt>" tells you that you're
talking to an Internet Kermit Service Daemon and it's waiting for a command
from your keyboard.  Begin by typing "help" (and then pressing the Enter or
Return key):

<p>

  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>help</u>

  IKS-NT 1.99 Dev.01, 1 Jan 2002, Copyright (C) 1995, 2002,
  Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York.

  Type INTRO   for a brief introduction to the Kermit Command screen.
  Type VERSION for version and copyright information.
  Type HELP    followed by a command name for help about a specific command.
  Type NEWS    for news about new features.
  Type SUPPORT to learn how to get technical support.
  Press ?      (question mark) at the prompt, or anywhere within a command,
               for a menu (context-sensitive help, menu on demand).
</pre>
<p>

Type "intro" (and then press the Enter or Return key).  Now you get a brief
introduction to the available commands.  Since the introduction is longer 
than your screen, K95 pauses at the end of each screenful to give you a chance
to read it, and gives you the prompt:

<p>
<pre>
  more? (Y or space-bar for yes, N for no)
</pre>
<p>

This occurs whenever K95 produces a long listing.  As the prompt says, press
the Space Bar or the Y key to continue to the next screenful, or the N (or Q)
key to quit and return to the prompt.  You can also press G (meaning "Go")
to show all the rest without pausing.

<h4>2.2.1. Getting Help for Individual Commands</h4>

The INTRO listing mentions various commands.  Pick one and type a HELP
command for it (remember to press the Enter or Return key after the last
word in the command), for example:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>help directory</u>
</pre>
<p>

This shows the kind of help text you can get for each command.  "help" and
"directory" are called keywords.  K95 lets you abbreviate keywords as much as
you want, as long as the abbreviation does not conflict with any other
keywords that are valid in the same position.  In this case you could use "he
dir", or even "h dir" ("h" is a special abbreviation for "help", even though
several other commands begin with "h").

<h4>2.2.2. Help and Completion for Command Fields</h4>

Now let's explore K95's context-sensitive help feature.  At the prompt, press
the ? (question-mark) key (on most keyboards this requires also holding down
the Shift key):

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>?</u> Command, one of the following:
   add           directory     increment     pwd           space
   apc           disable       input         query         statistics
   array         do            intro         quit          status
   ...
</pre>
<p>

(many more are shown).  These are K95's commands.  You can type HELP for any
of them.  But first, let's explore the "?" feature:

<p>
<ul>

<li>Press the "d" key, then "?".  Note how only the commands that start with
"d" are listed.  Also note that after they are listed, you get the prompt and
the "d" back, so you can continue from where you left off.

<p>

<li>Press the "i" key, then "?".  Now the commands that start with "di"
are listed, and you get your "di" keystrokes back so you don't have to
repeat them.

<p>

<li>Press the space bar and see what happens.  This illustrates that command
fields are delimited by spaces, and you terminated this field too soon,
since more than one command starts with "di" -- K95 doesn't know which
one you want.

<p>

<li>At the new prompt, type "dir" and then press the Space Bar.  This time
there is no complaint because only one command starts with "dir".

<p>

<li>Now press "?" to see what can come next.  Here you see a number of options,
and you also find out you can type a file specification.  Or for that
matter, you can press the Return or Enter key to start the command.  In
other words, you can type DIR, then zero or more options, and then an
optional file specification.  Here are some examples of legal DIRECTORY
commands:

<p>
<pre>
  directory                        <i>List all files and directories</i>
  dir                              <i>Ditto - you can abbreviate</i>
  dir *.txt                        <i>All files whose names end with ".txt"</i>
  dir /directories                 <i>List all directories</i>
  dir /directories a*              <i>List all directories starting with "a"</i>
  dir /files /reverse              <i>List all files in reverse order</i>
  dir /files /reverse *.c          <i>Ditto but only those ending with ".c"</i>
</pre>
<p>

<li>At a new prompt, type "di" and then press the Esc or Tab key.  K95 beeps
(rings the bell) at you to indicate that "di" is ambiguous in this field.
Now type "r" and press Esc or Tab again.  See how K95 completes the word
"directory" and supplies a space, positioning you at the next field.  This
feature is called completion.  It works for both keywords and filenames.

</ul>
<p>

K95's question-mark feature also works in filename fields.  If you type a
question mark when Kermit wants you to type a filename:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>take ?</u> Commands from file, one of the following:
</pre>
<p>

it lists the files in the current directory.  If you type part of a filename
and then question mark, K95 lists files that match the part you typed so far:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>take abc?</u>
</pre>
<p>

This lists all files whose names start with "abc" (see 
<a href="#x2.7">Section 2.7</a> for more about file lists).

<p>

Using Tab (or Esc) and Question Mark, you can easily feel your way through all
of K95's commands.  With some practice, you can fly through any command with
minimum effort and keystrokes.  If you make a mistake, you receive an
informative, context-sensitive error message.

<h3><a name="x2.3"><hr>2.3. How to Edit K95 Commands</a></h3>

K95 includes a simple command editor that uses Control characters.  You
produce a Control character by holding down the Ctrl or Control key on your
keyboard and then pressing a letter key.  For example, to type Ctrl-A, hold
down the Ctrl key, press the A key, and then let go of both keys.

<p>

The K95 command-editing keys are:

<p>
<pre>
  Backspace:  Erases the character left of the cursor.
  Delete:     Same as Backspace.
  Ctrl-H:     Same as Backspace.
  Ctrl-W:     Erases the "word" left of the cursor.
  Ctrl-U:     Erases back to the prompt.
</pre>
<p>

There is no way to edit the "inside" of a command; you can only
remove letters or words from the right.  You can't use Arrow, Function, or
Editing keys (such as Insert, Home, etc) to edit K95 commands.

<h3><a name="x2.4"><hr>2.4. Recalling Previous Commands</a></h3>

K95 remembers the last 10 commands you have entered (you can increase this
number with SET COMMAND RECALL-BUFFER-SIZE <i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is any
number).

<p>

To recall the previous command, type Ctrl-P ("P" for Previous) or Ctrl-B
("Back").  This displays the previous command at the prompt as if you had
typed it.  If you press the Enter or Return key, it is executed.  You can use
Ctrl-W or Backspace/Ctrl-H to edit it, or Ctrl-U to get back to the prompt.

<p>

To recall the command before the previous command, type Ctrl-P twice.  And
so on.  If you go back too far, you can use Ctrl-N ("Next") to move forwards.

<p>

The REDO command executes the most recent command that begins with the given
text, e.g. "redo dir" re-executes your most recent "dir" command.

<p>

SHOW HISTORY displays the command recall buffer.

<h3><a name="x2.5"><hr>2.5. Cancelling a Command in Progress</a></h3>

Ctrl-C should cancel any command in progress (i.e. after you have entered it
by pressing the Enter or Ctrl-C key).  If one Ctrl-C doesn't do it, try two
or three.

<h3><a name="x2.6"><hr>2.6. Special Characters in Commands</a></h3>

In the cross-platform Kermit command language, the backslash (<tt>\</tt>)
character is not taken literally, but indicates that whatever follows is to be
treated specially.  This lets you enter characters in commands that normally
are used for other purposes, such as control characters or question marks.  It
is also the basis for string substitution, macro processing, and script
programming.

<p>

But Windows uses backslash in file specifications, to separate directory
names from file names and from each other, e.g.:

<p>
<pre>
  C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\CONAGENT.EXE
</pre>
<p>

So to enter Windows filenames that contain backslashes at the Kermit command
prompt, you must either double them:

<p>
<pre>
  C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM\\CONAGENT.EXE
</pre>
<p>

or else use "forward slash" instead:

<p>
<pre>
  C:/WINDOWS/SYSTEM/CONAGENT.EXE
</pre>
<p>

(Under certain circumstances, K95 might recognize a single backslash in a
file or directory name as a directory separator -- in fact, it goes to
extraordinary lengths to "guess" whether you intend a single backslash to be
a directory separator or a variable- or function-introducer -- but since it
can't read your mind, it's best to use forward slash or double backslash
to eliminate all ambiguity.)

<p>

Another character to watch out for is Space.  Spaces are used by Kermit (and
all other command languages) to delimit fields within a command.  Since
Kermit is a file-transfer and management program, many of its commands
include filename fields.  But some Windows directory and file names contain
spaces, e.g.:

<p>
<pre>
  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Microsoft Photo Editor.lnk
</pre>
<p>

To refer to any such file at the Windows Command ("DOS") prompt, you must
enclose its name in doublequotes:

<p>
<pre>
  dir "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Microsoft Photo Editor.lnk"
</pre>
<p>

The same is true for Kermit.  Example: Suppose a file is called "My File" and
you want to make a copy of it called "Your File".  You might expect:

<p>
<pre>
  copy My File Your File
</pre>
<p>

to work, but it doesn't, not in K95, and not at the Windows command prompt
either: how is the command parser supposed to know where one name ends and
the next one begins?  Quoting is required:

<p>
<pre>
  copy "My File" "Your File"
</pre>
<p>

<h3><a name="x2.7"><hr>2.7. Multi-Purpose Fields</a></h3>

Many of K95's commands accept optional "switches", which are keywords that
start with "<tt>/</tt>" ("forward slash"), for example:

<p>
<pre>
  delete /list *.*
</pre>
<p>

meaning "delete all files in the current directory and list their names as
you delete them".  But since the switches are optional, and you can give
any number of them, K95 must also be prepared to let you type a filename
instead of a switch.

<p>

If you type "delete ?", the response is:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>del ?</u> File specification;
   or switch, one of the following:
   /all       /directories   /larger-than: /noheading    /recursive
   /after:    /dotfiles      /list         /nolist       /simulate
   /ask       /except:       /noask        /not-after:   /smaller-than:
   /before:   /heading       /nodotfiles   /not-before:  /summary
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; del 
</pre>
<p>

In other words, the available switches are listed.  But what if you want to
get a list of the filenames instead of a list of the available switches?  Use
this trick:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <tt>del ./?</tt> File(s) to delete, one of the following:
    (files are listed)
</pre>
<p>

In other words, type "<tt>./</tt>" before the question mark, which means
"current directory" (remember, we use forward slash as a directory separator
in K95, not backslash).  You could also type any other notation to let K95
know you want a file list, such as a disk letter ("<tt>delete</tt>
<tt>c:?</tt>"), or any directory path ("<tt>del</tt> <tt>subdir/?</tt>",
"<tt>del</tt> <tt>d:/tmp/?</tt>", etc) -- anything that does not begin with a
slash (<tt>/</tt>), so it won't look like a switch.

<h3><a name="x2.8"><hr>2.8. Screen Formatting</a></h3>

WIKSD does no screen formatting at all: No clearing the screen, no cursor
positioning, no sending escape sequences.  Your Telnet client does not need to
emulate any particular kind of terminal to use the Internet Kermit service.

<h3><a name="x2.9"><hr>2.9. Lots of Features</a></h3>

Kermit's file management features and other commands are many and varied;
it would (and does) require a thick book to describe them all.  If you would
like to have a copy of the book (<cite>Using C-Kermit</cite>), purchase a copy
of K95 yourself, or the book
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ck60manual.html"><cite>Using
C-Kermit</cite></a>.  Visit the 
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">Kermit website</a> for details.

<p>

Many of the commands have to do with file transfer (discussed in <a
href="#x3">Section 3</a>) or script programming (<a href="#x4">Section 4</a>).

<p>

Others have to do with customization.  Chief among these are the SET and
SHOW commands.  The SET command is used to set preferences, and the SHOW
command displays current settings.  If you don't like how something works,
chances are you can change it.  Type "help set" and "help show" for an
introduction.

<p>

Using just the information presented so far, you should be able make a
connection to a Windows-based Internet Kermit server and perform all the
file management tasks you could do in DOS, but more easily, since you always
have help text, menu-on-demand, command recall, and keyword/filename
completion at your fingertips.

WIKSD / K95 is not just a DOS shell replacement; it can also transfer files
over your Telnet connection using the Kermit protocol For this you need a
Telnet client that includes a Kermit protocol implementation, and for best
results it should also include Kermit autodownload and autoupload capability,
as well as the Telnet Kermit Option
(<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2840.txt">RFC2840</a>).  Examples:

<p>
<pre>
  <u>Autoup/download</u>   <u>Telnet Kermit Option</u>
       Yes                  Yes            <i><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html">C-Kermit</a> (Unix, VMS, etc)</i>
       Yes                  Yes            <i><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95.html">Kermit 95</a> (Windows and OS/2)</i>
       Yes                  No             <i><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/mskermit.html">MS-DOS Kermit</a> (DOS and Windows 3.x)</i>
       No                   No             <i>Most other Telnet clients</i>
</pre>
<p>

Depending on the capabilities of your Telnet client and your access rights
to the host PC, you can send or receive text or binary files in any mixture,
singly or in groups.

<p>

If your Telnet client does not support Kermit protocol at all, the rest of
this section is of no use to you.  If it is not from the Kermit Project, it
might support the Kermit protocol, but not well.  Obviously, for best results
we recommend a Kermit Project client, in which the protocol is
full-featured and fast, and we can support both ends of the connection.

<h3><a name="x3.1"><hr>3.1. Sending Files from IKSD to Your Computer</a></h3>

To send (or "download") a file from IKSD to your computer, simply give a SEND
command at the IKSD prompt for the desired file:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; send oofa.txt
</pre>
<p>

Hint: "send" can be abbreviated "s", even though other commands start with
the letter S:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; s oofa.txt
</pre>
<p>

Don't worry about text or binary mode -- K95 figures it out automatically.
If you want to force text or binary mode, however, you can use the /TEXT or
/BINARY switch:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; send /text oofa.txt
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; send /binary oofa.zip
</pre>
<p>

Of course you can also send files from other disks or directories that you
have access to:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; send d:/tmp/oofa.txt
</pre>
<p>

What happens next depends on your Telnet client.  If it supports autodownload,
the transfer begins automatically.  Otherwise, you have to take whatever
action your client requires to make it receive a file with Kermit protocol,
and after the transfer is complete, you might have to tell your client to
return to its terminal screen.

<p>

If you want to send a group of files, you can use "wildcards" in the file
name, which are special characters such as "<tt>*</tt>" that match patterns in
each file's name.  The "<tt>*</tt>" character is most commonly used; it means
"match any sequence of zero or more characters except period or slash".  So to
send all the files from the current directory, use:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>send *.*</u>
</pre>
<p>

To send all the files whose names end with ".txt", use:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>send *.txt</u>
</pre>
<p>

To send all the files whose names start with "a" and end with ".zip" in
all subdirectories of the current directory, use

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>send */a*.zip</u>
</pre>
<p>

and so on.  Lots of other wildcard possibilities are available too; type
"help wildard" at the <tt>IKSD&gt;</tt> prompt for details.

<p>

Wildcards give you one way of selecting files out of a group, but there are
others too.  You can get an idea by typing "<tt>send</tt> <tt>?</tt>" at the
<tt>IKSD&gt;</tt> prompt to get a list of the available SEND options:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>send ?</u> Filename, or switch, one of the following:
   /after:     /delete        /listfile:    /not-before:  /recursive
   /array:     /dotfiles      /mail:        /pathnames:   /rename-to:
   /as-name:   /except:       /move-to:     /print:       /smaller-than:
   /before:    /filter:       /nobackup     /protocol:    /starting-at:
   /binary     /filenames:    /nodotfiles   /quiet        /subject:
   /command    /larger-than:  /not-after:   /recover      /text
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; send 
</pre>
<p>

Of course you can use "help send" to get the details.  As you can see, it
is possible to construct a rather complex download, e.g. of all files whose
names match a certain pattern, but only if they are a certain size, and/or
were created before and/or after a certain date, and so on, and you can even
include an exception list.

<p>

Also, in case you want to send several files whose names can't be selected
by wildcards, you can use the MSEND command, which lets you give a list
of filenames to send:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>msend oofa.txt ../tmp/foo.zip *.c *.h</u>
</pre>
<p>

Note that the names are separated by spaces, not commas.

<p>

Don't worry about text- versus binary-mode tranfers; K95 automatically sends
each file in the appropriate mode.

<h3><a name="x3.2"><hr>3.2. Sending Files from Your Computer to IKSD</a></h3>

Uploading files to IKSD can be just as easy, but that depends on your Telnet
client.  If it is Kermit 95 or C-Kermit,
then just give a GET command to IKSD:

<p>
<pre>
  [C:\GUEST\] IKSD&gt; <u>get oofa.txt</u>
</pre>
<p>

and your client sends the requested file or files automatically, each in the
appropriate mode (text or binary).  As with SEND, there is a wide range of
options, which you can see by typing "<tt>get</tt> <tt>?</tt>" or
"<tt>help</tt> <tt>get</tt>".

<p>

For other clients, it's a bit more complicated:

<p>
<ol type="a">

<li>Tell IKSD to RECEIVE.  This makes it passively wait for your Telnet
client to send a file.

<p>

<li>Go back to your client's user interface ("escape back" or use its menu or
toolbar or whatever other method is provided) and tell it to send the desired
file or files in the required mode (text or binary) using Kermit protocol.

<p>

<li>After the transfer is finished, instruct your client to go back to its
terminal screen if necessary.

</ol>

<p>

Until now, we've treated WIKSD as an interactive shell.  There's another way
to use it, in which you interact only with your client, similar to the way you
would use an FTP client.  Obviously we can't document every client on earth,
so in this section we'll stick with our own:
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/k95.html">Kermit 95</a>,
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html">C-Kermit</a>, and to some
extent <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/mskermit.html">MS-DOS
Kermit</a>.  No other Telnet clients are known (at this writing) to support
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2839.txt">RFC2839</a> and
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2839.txt">2840</a>.

<p>

When you make a client/server connection to an Internet Kermit service,
your client does not enter its terminal screen, but rather stays in its
command screen, and once connected, you simply give commands to your client;
it passes them on to the server, which executes them and relays the result
back to your client.  To create such a connection, use the SET HOST command,
rather than the TELNET or IKSD command:

<p>
<pre>
  set host iks.kermit.columbia.edu kermit   <i>(or 1649)</i>
</pre>
<p>

Authentication details are omitted, since they vary depending on the type
of security, if any, negotiated between client and server.  If, for example,
you are in the same Kerberos realm as the server, and have a Kerberos identity
in that realm, you are connected without supplying a username or password
if you already have a ticket; otherwise you are prompted for them locally.

<p>

In the absence of any negotiated secure authentication methods, the client
command for logging in is REMOTE LOGIN (or simply LOGIN in K95 and C-Kermit):

<p>
<pre>
  remote login <i>myusername mypassword</i>
</pre>
<p>

If you omit the username and password from the <i>[</i> REMOTE <i>]</i> LOGIN
command, you are prompted for them separately, and the password does not echo:

<p>
<pre>
  <u>remote login</u>
  Username: <u>ivan</u>
  Password: <u>             </u>
</pre>
<p>

Once logged in, you can use SEND to upload files, GET to download them, and
use the REMOTE command for assorted file management tasks:

<p>
<pre>
  REMOTE CD <i>[ directory ]</i>        (RCD)     <i>Change server directory</i>
  REMOTE PWD                     (RPWD)    <i>Print working server directory</i>
  REMOTE DIRECTORY <i>[ filespec ]</i>  (RDIR)    <i>Get a listing of server-side files</i>
  REMOTE DELETE <i>[ filespec ]</i>     (RDEL)    <i>Delete files on the server</i>
  REMOTE TYPE <i>[ filespec ]</i>       (RTYPE)   <i>Type (display) a server file</i>
  REMOTE COPY <i>[ file1 file2 ]</i>    (RCOPY)   <i>Make a copy of a server file</i>
  REMOTE RENAME <i>[ file1 file2 ]</i>  (RREN)    <i>Rename a server file</i>
  REMOTE MKDIR <i>[ directory ]</i>     (RMKD)    <i>Create a directory on the server</i>
  REMOTE RMDIR <i>[ directory ]</i>     (RRMD)    <i>Remove a directory on the server</i>
</pre>
<p>

and so on.  Advanced usage includes REMOTE ASSIGN, REMOTE QUERY, and forth, to
set and query server variables and call server-based procedures.  When you are
finished with the server, use the LOGOUT, BYE, CLOSE, or HANGUP command to
disconnect.

The Kermit script language is built naturally upon its interactive command
language.  A simple example of a script program is a file containing a series
of Kermit commands.  If you tell Kermit to TAKE the file, it executes the
commands that are in it.  However, for a program to be generally useful, it
needs to operate on a variety of data -- e.g. to transfer different files at
different times -- and so there needs to be a way to pass "parameters" to
programs.  Programs generally also need to make decisions based on the
outcomes of the actions it takes, and they also often need to do something
repetitively.  Such programs require variables, control structures, grouping
and scoping rules, arrays and other data structures, arithmetic, functions for
processing strings and converting data, and so forth.  K95 (WIKSD) has all of
those, but it's beyond the scope of this short introduction to explain them;
they are explained at length in the published manuals.  The main thing to note
here is that you can script your client to control the server (assuming your
client is scriptable) or you can script the server itself, or any combination
you can think of.  For example, if you have write access to a directory on the
IKSD, you can upload script programs to it and have it execute them.  Or... a
client-side script can send a macro definition to the server and have it
execute the macro and return its result in a variable for further local
processing.

You can find a Kermit script programming tutorial and lots of sample
scripts here:

<b>Scripted sessions with IKSD are especially easy</b>, because everything is
done with client-side commands -- there are no INPUT/OUTPUT sequences, no
"screen scraping", etc.  Matters become complicated when security is involved,
since the script writer must know in advance exactly what forms of security
are supported -- or required -- by the server, and what procedures and
paramaters are involved to make a securely authenticated encrypted session.

<p>

Assuming an insecure version of WIKSD (such as the free IKSDNT program),
here is an outline of a scripted session:

<p>
<pre>
  set host xyzcorp.com kermit        ; Substitute the host of your choice
  if fail exit 1 Connection failed   ; Make sure connection worked
  remote login myuserid mypassword   ; Log in
  if fail exit 1 Login failed
  ; <i>(file-transfer and -management commands here)</i>
  bye
</pre>
<p>

Obviously it's a bad idea to put passwords in files, so instead you can have
the script prompt the user when the script starts:

<p>
<pre>
  undefine pass	
  while not defined pass {
      askq pass { Password: }
  }
  set host xyzcorp.com kermit        ; Substitute the host of your choice
  if fail exit 1 Connection failed   ; Make sure connection worked
  remote login myuserid \m(pass)     ; Log in
  if fail exit 1 Login failed
  ; <i>(file-transfer and -management commands here)</i>
  bye
</pre>
<p>

In case you have a security-capable Kermit client and a security-capable
server, but you want to make a non-secure clear-text connection (e.g. on a
local switched network, and/or for experimenting with script features without
first having to become a security and cryptography expert), you can give
the following commands to your client to disable its security features:

<p>
<dl>

<dt><tt>SET TELOPT AUTH REFUSED</tt></dt>

<dd>This tells the client not to request any form of Telnet authentication and
to refuse it if offered by the server.  This prevents (for example) possible
NTLM username / password popups, which wait for a response from the operator,
thus halting progress of the script.

<p>

<dt><tt>SET AUTHENTICATION TLS VERIFY OFF</tt></dt>

<dd>This tells the client not to require certification of the host's
authenticity.  This eliminates certain kinds of prompts that are given for
your own protection, but which can halt the progress of a script, such as:
<p>
<pre>
  Warning: Server didn't provide a certificate, continue? (Y/N)
</pre>
<p>

Use this command if the client and the server both support TLS security, but
the required certificates are lacking (or, to put it another way, if you don't
know what TLS is, but you get the above message, use this command to suppress
it).  This allows you to make an encrypted connection, but without assurrance
that the host you are connecting to is the on you think it is.
