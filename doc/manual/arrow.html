<h2>Arrow Key Summary</h2>

An arrow key is not a regular key that has a single
<a href="gloss.htm#ascii"> ASCII</a> character assigned to it; there are
no ASCII arrow characters.  Therefore arrow keys must send "escape sequences".
Each kind of terminal is likely to use different sequences, and even on the
same kind of terminal, an arrow key might be in different "modes", meaning 
the same arrow key might send different sequences at different times.
<p>
For example, the cursor (arrow) keypad on the VT100 terminal (or above) can be
in one of two modes: <b>cursor mode</b> and <b>application mode</b>.  These
keys send different escape sequences depending on which mode they are in.
When the VT terminal is turned on (and when Kermit is started), the arrow keys
are in cursor mode.
<p>
By default (that is, unless you give SET KEY commands to change things),
Kermit uses the PC keyboard arrow keys as the VT terminal arrow keys.  Each
key has a "verb" assigned to it:
<p>
<pre>
  Up arrow      \Kuparr
  Down arrow    \Kdnarr
  Right arrow   \Krtarr
  Left arrow    \Klfarr
</pre>
<p>

These verbs track the cursor keypad mode automatically, and send the
appropriate escape sequences.  For example, for DEC VT100 and higher:
<p>
<pre>
               <i>Cursor Mode   Application Mode</i>
  \Kuparr        CSI A           SS3 A
  \Kdnarr        CSI B           SS3 B
  \Krtarr        CSI C           SS3 C
  \Klfarr        CSI D           SS3 D
</pre>
<p>
where CSI is ESC followed by left bracket ([) on a 7-bit connection or decimal
155 on an 8-bit connection, and SS3 is ESC followed by O (uppercase letter O)
on a 7-bit connection and decimal 143 on an 8-bit connection.
<p>
How does the cursor keypad mode change?  The host can change it by sending
special escape sequences, or you can change it yourself by using the command:
<p>
<pre>
  SET TERMINAL ARROW-KEYS <i>{</i> CURSOR, APPLICATION <i>}</i>
</pre>
<p>

When arrow keys are not working, what could be the reason?
<ol>
<li>Because the application you are using on the host does not support
arrow keys.
<p>
<li>Because of a terminal-type mismatch.  Different kinds of terminals send
different escape sequences for arrow keys.
<p>
<li>Because the application expects the keypad to be in one mode when it
is in the other mode.  This is a deficiency on the part of the
application.  Applications should never <i>assume</i> which mode the cursor
keypad is in, but rather, they should PUT the keypad in the desired
mode, or else they should accept arrow-key codes from either mode.
Workaround: tell Kermit to <tt>SET TERM ARROW CURSOR</tt> (or
<tt>APPLICATION</tt>).
<p>
<li>Because of a character-size mismatch.  If you have been using a VMS-based
VT220 or VT320 fullscreen application (such as EVE, ALEPH, etc), you might
find that your arrow keys are sending 8-bit codes rather than 7-bit codes, and
then when switching to another application like Lynx, the new application
might not understand the 8-bit codes.  Again, this is a deficiency of the
application.  Workaround: tell Kermit to <tt>SET TERM CONTROLS 7</tt>.
</ol>
<p>
Here is a summary of the default uses of gray (cursor keypad) arrow keys in
Kermit 95:
<p><pre><hr>
<i>Shift  Alt  Ctrl   Description</i><hr>
                    Terminal arrow keys
             X      Go to bookmark in scrollback buffer
        X           Search in scrollback buffer
        X    X      (unassigned)
   X                Scroll left/right one column
   X         X      (unassigned)
   X    X           Scroll left/right 8 columns
   X    X    X      Scroll all the way left or right<hr>
</pre><p>

In the Command screen, the Up and Down arrow keys can be used for command
recall.
<p>
In EMACS and Word Perfect modes, the arrow keys send the appropriate
cursor movement commands for those applications.
